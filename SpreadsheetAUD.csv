A&R Director,52119,Music Business & Management,"a&r director, record label, companies, artists & repertoire, ","What does an A&R Director do?
 A&R directors run the record label or music publisher department responsible for finding and nurturing musical talent, holistically planning artists' careers, and supervising recording projects. Although their day-to-day duties vary based on the size and structure of the company employing them, A&R directors are united by a common mission: to shape the musical roster and release catalogue to best achieve the company's aesthetic and commercial goals. This could mean setting guidelines and directives for A&R managers and talent scouts, approving departmental budgets, liaising with other department heads to ensure smooth interdepartmental cooperation, advocating for the interests of the A&R Department in meetings with label executives, courting major unsigned recording artists, or developing valuable new resources and connections for the department.
 Nearly every aspect of a recording project-from song selection and recording technology to final mixes and marketing strategies-is under the director ´s purview.
 What an A&R director does on a daily basis has everything to do with the company and department in question. A&R directors at major labels, for example, oversee sizeable departments filled with A&R managers, representatives, administrators, coordinators, and interns. These major label directors generally don't have time to get granular and instead can be found signing high-impact, big-name artists; approving important budgets, schedules, marketing strategies, and career choices; developing the label's industry connections and other resources; and fulfilling the needs of the board of executives. On the other hand, being an A&R director at a small indie label might mean overseeing the artistic identity of the label's roster; taking care of the department's budgeting; creating connections with other labels, publishers, and arts organizations; and-in whatever time is left-acting as an additional administrator or manager.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 The A&R director is the highest position in the A&R Department, answering only to the label's executives. Most directors start either as A&R representatives-following a scouting and artist management track-or as administrators-following an administrative, numbers-oriented track. A representative or administrator who does excellent, indispensable work may be promoted to A&R manager in five years or less, while becoming an A&R director may take significantly longer, in addition to a suite of successful projects. Those who manage to make the cut and become directors have the opportunity to cultivate a varied and successful musical lineup, acquire clout and prestige for their label, or even rise to the executive ranks.
 Finding Work
 A&R directors work for music publishing companies as well as major and independent record companies. In order to land this coveted senior position, a candidate must possess an impressive track record of successful artists and albums in addition to copious connections in the music industry. Most A&R directors are promoted internally after working many years with the company.
 Professional Skills
 Keen ear for music
 Ability to observe, forecast, and create trends
 Marketing
 Personnel management
 Budgeting
 Networking and relationship building
 Leadership
 Multitasking
 Interpersonal Skills
 The ideal A&R director possesses a powerful vision for the label's music, an excellent sense of business and the bottom line, great ears, and enviable connections. He or she should be a critical thinker, multitasker, and networker who can oversee artists and employees alike while confidently advancing a much broader plan, often influenced by a nuanced and current sense of musical tastes and trends. Persuasive communication skills and the ability to deftly navigate corporate politics are a plus.
 Work Life
 This is an all-consuming executive position, involving an enormous amount of travel and a high-intensity work schedule that jumps between meeting rooms, recording studios, music venues, airplanes, hotels, and restaurants. A&R directors at small indie labels might not see as much airplane travel, but they're still likely to find themselves working around the clock and moving between drastically different settings-it's simply the nature of this field.

Accompanist,51122,Musicians and Singers,"accompanist, piano, duet, vocalist, performances, collaborative","What does an Accompanist do?
 Accompanists-who typically play instruments like piano, organ, or guitar-are professional musicians who make a living by supporting, collaborating with, and sometimes also educating vocalists, choirs, dancers, theater performers, and other artists. Accompanists go by many different titles depending on the specifics of their profession or employment: church musicians and church music directors, for example, may accompany the church choir as pianists or organists; television show band members accompany guest performers and sketch segments; collaborative pianists perform with vocalists and soloists; and repetiteurs accompany and teach opera singers and dancers in a rehearsal environment.
 Opportunities abound for accompanists, ranging from tiny theater troupes and local choirs to major ballet and opera companies.
 The work of an accompanist is nuanced and demanding, requiring them to respond nimbly and sensitively to performance elements such as tempo, phrasing, and interpretation, often while collaborating with a singer for the first time and sometimes in high-pressure settings like competitions and auditions. In addition, many accompanists double as teachers or educators, and must be capable of teaching and monitoring a student's performance while playing. As part of their job, staff accompanists often perform administrative tasks such as compiling and organizing requests from students.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Professional musicians who accompany as part of their work are spread across a number of different industries. Those who specialize purely in accompanying others, however, are most common in the fields of music, dance, and theater education. Most accompanists begin as freelancers, finding work through personal connections, networking, and job postings. Once an accompanist has achieved a certain level of expertise and prominence, he or she might be eligible for full-time, salaried positions with an arts organization or university. An accompanist might go on to a career as a music teacher or music director.
 Finding Work
 Opportunities abound for accompanists, ranging from tiny theater troupes and local choirs to major ballet and opera companies. Most are freelancers who work for a combination of regular and one-off clients, including choirs, K-12 schools, universities, conservatories, dance companies, and theater companies. In addition to assisting in public performance and rehearsal, they might also accompany students and musicians in auditions, juries, exams, and competitions. As for any independent contractor, networking is key to finding work.
 Others, generally more seasoned or accomplished players, are hired as full-time staff by conservatories, arts companies, and universities.
 Professional Skills
 Sight-reading
 Broad musical repertoire and knowledge
 Collaboration (rehearsed and on-the-spot)
 Great ears for musical nuance (tempo, phrasing, tone, etc.)

 Punctuality
 Interpersonal Skills
 Accompanists are highly skilled instrumentalists with a deep interest in collaboration and education. The job requires immense adaptability and comfort with the unpredictability of live performance. In addition, accompanists must possess the ability to work together with almost anyone, and to take direction quickly and quietly.
 Work Life
 Most accompanists work on a different schedule every week, although those with full-time positions at conservatories might have more consistency. Rehearsals and performances are often scheduled at night and on weekends.

Acoustical Consultant,52119,Music Business & Management,"acoustic, acoustical, consultant, physics, sound, microphone, recording, math, environment, material, physic, science, hear, hearing","What does an Acoustical Consultant do?
 Combining architectural drafting skills with a deep knowledge of applied acoustics, a branch of physics that focuses on sound, acoustical consultants help design or modify physical spaces and sometimes sound systems to achieve their clients' sonic needs. The services offered by acoustical consultants can generally be broken down into three categories:
 Design-working alone or in tandem with dedicated architects to create plans for an acoustically oriented space
 Soundproofing-making an existing interior space acoustically isolated so that outside sound doesn't come in and inside sound doesn't get out
 Optimization-improving the way sound travels through an existing space to ensure clean, controllable, and flexible acoustics
 As research has confirmed the negative impact of unwanted noise on health, wellbeing, attention, and learning, more and more people have become aware of the value of acoustically intelligent spaces, leading to an increased and diversified demand for acoustical consulting services. Today, acoustical consultants work with a wide variety of clients on spaces including residential homes and developments, business offices, schools, hospitals, libraries, museums, retail stores and shopping malls, movie theaters, theme parks, and more.
 In addition, acoustical consultants have long had a home within the music and live performance industries. Working alongside or as studio designers, they help to design and modify recording and performance spaces alike. In comparison with all-purpose acoustical consultants, those who work mostly with music industry clients tend to have specialized knowledge of amplification and recording equipment, similar to live sound systems engineers.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Many acoustical consultants begin working after earning their B.S. in a relevant field, while others go for a master's degree in acoustical engineering or architecture. Early in their careers, the vast majority of acoustical consultants work for acoustical consulting companies, either as full-time employees or contracted freelancers. Those who enjoy working with amplifiers and other hardware to solve sonic problems in environments like performance spaces and event halls may go on to become live sound systems engineers, while those who gravitate towards designing recording spaces may become studio designers. Generally speaking, the most highly regarded and successful acoustical consultants study further in architecture and incorporate it into their practice, allowing them to take on more difficult, extensive, and lucrative projects: designing the plans for a new concert hall, for example.
 Finding Work
 The most secure option, particularly for beginning acoustical consultants, is to be employed by an acoustical consulting company or architectural consulting group. These opportunites are usually advertised on conventional job posting websites like Indeed, Monster, or Glassdoor. However, there are also opportunities for freelance acoustical consultants, for whom finding work is a matter of networking and visibility. Freelancers and full-time employees alike must be capable of forming strong relationships with clients as this is the heart and soul of the consulting industry.

 Interpersonal Skills
 Strong communication skills are very important for acoustical consultants, both with regard to clients and to the design process, which is frequently collaborative. Although acoustical measuring tools do much of the heavy lifting, acoustical consultants must also be sensitive listeners in their own right, capable of picking up on slight differences in tone, frequency, and vibration.
 Work Life
 The vast majority of acoustical consultants are salaried employees of small acoustical-consulting companies, although those who have successfully found a plentiful market or niche may thrive as freelancers. Most of the work takes place during business hours from an office, but projects, which frequently require on-site work, can affect this. While working on a project, acoustical consultants may split their time between their office and wherever their project is based, or, in rare cases, uproot entirely and work in proximity to the project. This can mean occasional travel or periods away from home.

Actor,53121,"Acting, Theatre & Dance","actor, body, story, movement, pretend, television, stage, filming, act, memorize, camera, singer, psychology, ","? Everyone knows what actors do: they use their voices and bodies to tell stories. One of the world's oldest professions, acting is in many ways a unique vocation, the core of which stays the same whether an actor is performing onstage with a theater company, lending their voice to a video game or animation, or filming an advertisement. Actors embody, entertain, and, well, act. They get up on stage, before the camera, or behind the microphone and create a performance that engages, entertains, incites, and affects their audience.
 
 There is an exceptional range of experiences and opportunities available to professional actors.
 That having been said, today's actor does much more than just perform. Reading and interpreting scripts, memorizing complex lines and movements, rehearsing for hours on end, perfecting warm-up and cool-down routines, and auditioning again and again are all part of an actor's work. Additionally, extra work is often required anytime an actor takes on a particularly difficult role; this could mean anything from developing a specific accent or movement style to undertaking intense physical, vocal, emotional, or holistic training. As any actor knows, the preparatory work and the performance are not separate they are two parts of the same process.
 
 People in the Field
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Actors come from a great variety of backgrounds, work in a number of distinct industries, and develop their craft in different ways which is to say that there's far more than a single career path for an actor. Many are self-taught, while others have certificates, BAs, BFAs, or master's degrees, the latter of which enables them to work as drama teachers at a university level. Most begin working professionally in their early 20s, at which point they're unlikely to support themselves solely by acting. Beginning actors might supplement their acting income by working administrative or technical positions within their industry, or by teaching children.
 
 Acting work tends to follow a fairly steady cycle go out for auditions, land a part, prepare, perform, and repeat and each successful gig contributes to a young actor's resume, reputation, and professional network, enabling the actor to audition for better parts, work with higher profile directors, and negotiate higher pay. At a certain point in the career, most actors partner with an agent in order to get access to high-profile gigs. Actors might go on to become directors, producers, playwrights, or drama therapists. Many also work as voice actors.
 
 Finding Work
 The word acting tends to conjure specific images in the mind of an outsider: usually, a star performer on stage or screen. In truth, there is an exceptional range of experiences and opportunities available to professional actors. Actors work on films, television shows, advertisements, plays, musicals, radio pieces, puppet shows, and video games. They might perform in comedy and improv shows, or participate in interdisciplinary artistic collaborations. In addition to entertainment work, they might also appear in informational or instructional videos, skits, and demonstrations. Although the film and stage industries are centered around New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, actors work in cities throughout the country.
 
 When it comes to finding work as an actor, auditioning is the name of the game. Although it can be frustrating to continually prove one's ability to producers and casting directors, it is a fundamental aspect of the career for all but the top performers. Of course, networking can make the audition process easier, and actors who develop the skills and connections to produce their own projects may be able to avoid auditioning entirely.

 Memorization (text and movement)
 Auditioning (monologues)

 Collaboration
 Time management

 Specific acting pedagogies or techniques (e.g. Stanislavsky, Meisner, American method, Alexander)
 Interpersonal Skills
 Although acting is often described as a fiercely competitive profession, it is also a deeply collaborative one. Actors should strive to be professional, respectful, and flexible throughout the rehearsal process; this includes being prompt and prepared for rehearsal. A reputation for inflexibility or unprofessional behavior can seriously affect an actor's career. Additionally, the best actors are as committed to their job offstage as they are onstage. They practice and research their role with dedication, and do whatever they can to support fellow actors in their processes. Additionally, this is a field in which professional networking is exceptionally beneficial; an outgoing or friendly personality and willingness to put oneself out there at parties and other events can be very helpful.
 
 Work Life
 Generally speaking, actors' work lives follow a cycle: audition, get a part, prepare, perform, and repeat. As they work on productions, all but the most successful actors tend to hold down one or more other jobs. In almost every major acting industry, the job means working long hours and late nights. Stage actors are generally called in the evening to avoid conflicts with day jobs, while film actors may be called for 12 hours or more. Working in the film industry often necessitates travel, whereas stage actors generally only travel if relocating to another city in order to participate in a specific production or touring.",https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/actor
Adaptive Arts Teacher,51122,Music Education,"adaptive, arts, teacher, teach, students, therapy, ","What does an Adaptive Arts Teacher do?
 Adaptive arts teachers are trained to bring music, dance, theater, and other art forms into the lives of students with disabilities through educational experiences. Not to be confused with music or expressive-arts therapists, who use engagement with the arts to achieve specific cognitive or behavioral goals, adaptive arts teachers seek to broadly enrich and expand their students' knowledge, skills, and interest in the arts.
 Using their training in one or more art forms, their training as arts educators, and their core knowledge of a broad range of disabilities-intellectual, emotional, orthopedic, visual, and auditory-adaptive teachers establish inclusive learning environments for students who learn, communicate, behave, or use their bodies differently than many of their peers.
 They do this by expanding the playing field: providing multiple pathways for a student's expressions and actions, presenting information in a range of formats and media, and engaging a student's interest in a host of ways. They also use a wide range of assessment tools to measure and understand their students' learning and development as artists, including observations, checklists, rubrics, tests, and performance tasks. Ultimately, adaptive arts teachers aim to create learning environments in which students of all abilities can thrive.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 In order to work as an adaptive arts teacher, most employers require an undergraduate major in the art form (as a practitioner), in education, or in special education. Teacher licensure is desirable, and a master's degree is often preferred. While many train and plan to become adaptive arts teachers from the get-go, occasionally a sensitive and flexible arts teacher finds that she is particularly comfortable with teaching students with disabilities. That teacher may wish to become an adaptive arts teacher and can do so by seeking training and education in teaching students with special needs.
 Adaptive teachers usually work several part-time positions, and can advance by finding full-time positions, by building a strong reputation for their private studios, or by taking on the leadership of entire school departments or education programs as a program director at a private school that serves children with disabilities.
 Finding Work
 There are four main settings in which adaptive arts teachers usually work: private studios, community arts and after-school programs, private schools, and public schools. Many special-education websites feature job listings, including the National Association of Special Education Teachers

 and the National Association of Private Special Education Centers

 Knowledge and understanding of various special needs populations
 Patience
 Empathy
 Organizational skills
 Interpersonal Skills
 Above all, adaptive teachers must cultivate patience and flexibility, as there is great variation in the learning needs of students with disabilities. Equally vital is a genuine desire to work with differently abled students.
 Work Life
 Often, adaptive arts teachers combine part-time teaching positions in several settings rather than working a single full-time job. As such, a certain amount of daily travel is usually a necessary part of the career. Each week, a typical adaptive arts teacher might work at multiple schools for one to three days, lead after-school programs on a few afternoons, and run a private studio in the free hours between. Working in a school setting tends to mean standard and fixed hours, while working out of a private practice requires some flexibility in scheduling. For adaptive arts teachers, no two schedules are alike.

Arranger,51121,"Composition, Scoring, and Songwriting","arranger, arranging, live music, musical theater, rework, scores, scoring, theatre, theater, musical theatre,","What does an Arranger do?
 Arrangers help finish, rework, and adapt preexisting compositions by altering elements such as instrumentation, orchestration, harmony, tempo, and genre.
 Arrangers work in a number of professional industries, including live music, musical theater, the record industry, and film and TV. Many combine arranging with another skill. For example, arranger-bandleaders adapt existing compositions to develop pieces for their own ensemble; arranger-producers create new studio arrangements based on their overarching vision for the recording; and music preparation specialists use arranging in combination with proofreading and orchestration skills to become one-stop shops for music preparation.
 While most arrangements aim to preserve the melody, lyrics, and formal structures of a piece, there's still a tremendous amount of creative freedom and self-expression within an arranger's work. For example, arrangers might come up with new chords to use as a base for the melody, strip down or build up the instrumentation, adapt for a completely different instrumentation style (e.g. change rock instrumentation to classical instrumentation), slow down or speed up the tempo, add electronic elements inspired by the original composition, write a new introduction or ending, or add entirely new vocal or instrumental harmonies. Ultimately, an arranger can wind up having just as much impact on the composition as the original composer or songwriter.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 In such a creative field, there's far more than one path to become an arranger. One arranger might make a living by adapting existing songs for new stage or film musicals; another might be a bandleader who crafts new arrangements for her ensemble to play; and another might specialize in creating new arrangements of popular songs for the film and TV industry, so that studios can avoid paying for the rights to expensive recordings.
 Arrangers might also work as orchestrators, conductors, bandleaders, music directors, instrumental performers, record producers, and event producers. These positions represent the larger musical community to which arrangers belong, and within which they must network and collaborate if they wish to succeed.

 Work Life
 Arrangers generally set their own hours, although those who work in certain industries (e.g. film) can have tight deadlines. One of the benefits of being an arranger, like being a composer, is that most networking opportunities take place in the form of concerts, performances, and other music-related activities.

 A brand adviser, business advocate, and 24/7 ally, the artist manager-or in the entertainment industry, simply the ""manager""- is one of the most impactful professionals in any artist or band's support team, weighing in on every career decision from long-term goals to what's for lunch. An artist manager's specific duties vary depending on the industry in question as well as the size and stage of their client's career, but often include some combination of those typically associated with an A&R representative, PR agent, business manager, or talent agent in addition to overseeing the artist or band directly and representing the artist's interests with employers. Almost all artist managers share a close professional relationship with their clients-they're in it together, for better or worse.
 The most successful managers are egoless, thick-skinned, and tenacious, ready and able to advocate tirelessly behind the scenes on behalf of their client.
 Artist managers shape their clients' careers both in a day-to-day and long-term sense. They often help clients book gigs, plan album projects, orchestrate record releases and tours, create marketing and merchandising strategies, get paid for their work, and establish and pursue long-term career goals. However, a manager's job can extend far beyond this; they are their clients' advocate, which can mean negotiating record contracts, mediating interpersonal conflicts within the band, fighting on behalf of a client who's not receiving the treatment agreed upon in the contract, lobbying on a client's behalf with labels, producers, agents, and promoters, and even helping a client improve their mental and physical health. Recently, in response to shifts in the music industry, managers devote more time to leveraging a band's brand equity to create revenue streams and strategic partnerships.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Artist managers tend to fall into two groups. Some managers possess little training or professional experience, falling into the career when a family member or close friend catches a break and needs a trusted adviser to guide their fledgling career. Others gradually work their way up from managing local acts in their hometown, climb the corporate ladder at a management company, or switch careers from working as personal assistants, project managers, talent agents, A&R representatives, or song pluggers. Those who make artist management their long-term career usually manage multiple clients at a time, and the most successful among them can go on to found management companies-or ""agencies""-based around their roster of clients.
 Finding Work
 As with many freelance-oriented jobs, it can be difficult to find one's first gig as an artist manager. Some start by managing artists or groups they already know, while others apply for positions at management companies, found their own, or join an artist's team in a different capacity-as a business manager, agent, or personal assistant-before taking over management duties.

 In order to be a successful manager, one must be intelligent, creative, egoless, hardworking, organized, and thick-skinned.

Perhaps most importantly, managers should have the flexibility, communication skills, and emotional intelligence to adjust their management style to fit their clients' needs.
 Work Life
 A career as a manager is consuming, with very little divide between work hours and pleasure hours. As a result, it suits impassioned and driven individuals who are comfortable working around the clock. Most days are packed with meetings, small business transactions, and planning for the future, while nights are dedicated to live music and networking events. Depending on the client, an artist manager may travel frequently as part of the job-including on tour, although successful clients may have the funds to hire a separate tour manager.

 Artist relations managers are broadly responsible for keeping artists happy in their relationship with a company-whether it's a record label, a company whose brand or product an artist is endorsing, or an organization for whom an artist is creating promotional content. The heart of an ARM's job is building a good relationship and an open channel of communication with the artist, ensuring his or her satisfaction while identifying and diffusing potential conflicts that might cause the alliance to deteriorate.
 This is a job for someone who is detail-oriented, efficient, and above all, extremely sociable.
 While the specific tasks of an ARM vary greatly depending on the company in question-and particularly whether that company represents artists, serves artists, or is represented by artists-ARMs are likely to coordinate with many different company departments and the artist's own team in pursuit of their goals. An ARM might be closely involved in organizing the artist's marketing, promotion, media, management, publicity, and/or personnel, or could simply act as a direct line between the artist and the company, responsible for communicating feedback and decisions between the two groups and maintaining the artist's interest in the company. ARMs may also handle paperwork, facilitate contracts, maintain social media accounts, process ticket requests, and schedule activities such as promotional trips, aftershow parties, and launch events.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Some artist relations managers begin as interns or assistants in this or a closely related field (e.g. community management or social media management), advancing up the departmental ladder. Others, however, work for some time as or with artists, gaining valuable connections and life experiences that help them as artist relations managers. Working as an artist relations manager can also be a jumping off point to jobs in A&R or artist management.
 Successful websites related to music or content creation like YouTube, Bandcamp, Genius, Etsy, or Twitch have created new markets for artist relations managers.
 Finding Work
 Artist relations managers work for three main kinds of companies: companies that represent artists, companies that work closely with artists, and product-based companies that have marketing or promotional relationships with artists. This includes record labels, management companies, PR firms, gear or merchandise manufacturers, event producers, and lifestyle brands. ARMs can also work for websites, particularly those that interface with artists frequently or depend on independent artists for content creation.

Others are constantly on the move, making contact with new artists, checking in with old ones, and generally establishing a presence in the scene.

 Artistic directors take on the challenge of developing a recognizable artistic identity or brand for a nonprofit arts organization, such as a symphony orchestra, opera company, dance company, or theater company. Designing the company's performance season is a pivotal part of the job, and involves choosing themes to explore; selecting original works to develop; commissioning writers, composers, and/or choreographers to create new work; and hiring directors or conductors to bring the performance pieces to life. In addition, artistic directors are likely to produce, direct, conduct, or choreograph work themselves.
 Artistic directors are eminent creatives within their field, possessing a wealth of knowledge, experience, and professional connections to draw upon in leading their company.
 While their chief duty is to manage and direct the performance wing of the organization, artistic directors also weigh in on decisions made by the marketing, fundraising, and business departments-for example, arguing for or against branding changes, approving development events such as galas and VIP performances, or creating reduced-price ticket programs to bring in younger audiences. While some artistic directors choose to focus entirely on the creative side of the job, leaving non-artistic tasks to a general manager or managing director, most are deeply involved in the administration and management of the company as pertaining to its future success.
 In the orchestra world, music director is often used as an equivalent title to artistic director.

 Career Path
 Artistic directors are eminent creatives within their fields, possessing a wealth of knowledge, experience, and professional connections to draw upon in leading their company. In terms of education, a Master of Fine Arts degree isn't required, but is often preferred. Artistic directors are usually current or former directors, producers, conductors, music directors, bandleaders, choreographers, or dancers, depending on whether they belong to a theatrical, musical, or dance organization. For most, becoming an artistic director is the culmination of their career in the arts; progressing from there usually means filling a similar role at a larger or more prestigious organization.
 Finding Work
 Artistic directors are employed by theater companies, dance companies, opera companies, symphony orchestras, and museums. They may be promoted from within the organization after many years of service, or hired externally after a search among highly qualified individuals. Artistic directors answer to the company's board of directors.

 Interpersonal Skills
 Artistic directors are leaders and spokespeople, which means they need to have excellent public speaking, communication, and delegation skills. Multitasking without losing focus is a priceless skill that serves artistic directors well, given the varied nature of the position. Negotiation skills and the ability to compromise are equally key.
 As executives, artistic directors answer directly to their company's board of directors. This means that at times, artistic directors must be ready to persuasively and articulately represent the interests of the performance wing of the organization, as well as their own vision for the company.
 Work Life
 The work life of an artistic director varies based on the size of the arts organization in question. Artistic directors of smaller organizations are likely to also be the company's CEO and principal director, conductor, or choreographer, leading to a packed schedule that includes both administrative and artistic duties. Artistic directors of large and established arts organizations are likely to break up desk work with frequent travel and meetings in order to maintain or build relationships with vital donors, as well as broker new artistic collaborations. They may also participate in conferences, conventions, and other industry events (such as the Tonys). The hours are long and the work is hard, but that's not likely to deter anyone who's made it this far in their artistic career.

Assistant to the Composer,51121,"Composition, Scoring, and Songwriting","assistant to the composer, composing,","What does an Assistant to the Composer do?
 Composers-especially those who work on films, television shows, and video games-require lots of additional labor and support to accomplish their job. Most hire and employ a small team that works out of their home or professional studio. The composer ´s assistant is one member of this team: a jack-of-all-trades who does whatever is necessary to support the composer, and in so doing gains insight into the composer's process.
 Daily Responsibilities
 It usually falls to the composer's assistant to keep the studio running efficiently. This might mean renaming and organizing files, installing and updating audio software, straightening up the studio, managing cables, being a messenger when needed, and bouncing stems at the end of the day.
 Tech Tasks
 The composer's assistant may also assist with recording sessions, mix and edit recorded audio, build custom environments for the composer, redesign setups, program synths, or solve technical problems as they arise. Some composers hire assistants particularly to use their knowledge of sample libraries to improve the composer's MIDI sketches-a field known as MIDI orchestration.
 Musical Assignments
 Composer's assistants also sometimes assist with the composition process. This might mean notating a passage as the composer plays it, reviewing notated passages as a proofreader, orchestrating from a composer's MIDI sketch, arranging one of the composer's pieces for a specific purpose, booth reading during a recording session, or even writing a short cue in the composer's style.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 For a long time, working as a composer ´s assistant has been touted as the first step toward a career as a composer, serving as a sort of practical apprenticeship. Today, however, it's far from being solely an educational experience. Most assistants are treated as employees first and foremost, with the consequence that they are expected to bring a seriously developed skillset to the table from day one. The job of an assistant sometimes seems to have more in common with the work of film orchestrators, copyists, and assistant engineers than that of a composer.
 Still, the opportunity to learn from the composer-and the other members of the composer's team, which functions almost as a small music production company-should not be undervalued. When assistants feel they have gained enough, usually after a year or two, they break off and head in new directions. Some might join Hollywood music production houses, others might start new freelance careers as orchestrators or copyists, and a lucky few might make it as film, television, video game, or freelance composers.
 Finding Work
 Assistantships are fairly unlikely to be advertised on conventional job listing websites, so it might be a matter of creating a position rather than finding one. As such, it's doubly important to be assertive and to advocate for one's own importance and usefulness. Aspiring composer's assistants should reach out to established composers whose work they appreciate with an explanation of their skills and abilities, as well as a proposal for how these abilities could improve or aid the composer's process.

 Television composer Michael Price (Sherlock) explains it well: ""It ´s kind of unlikely that you ´re going to want anyone with an attitude. You ´re going to be working closely together, through late nights, so a sense of humor is going to be important. The composer is going to be dealing with lots of political and big-picture pressure that you may not even be aware of, so they ´re unlikely to want someone less organized than them. Or less committed. But what they would, I ´m pretty sure, appreciate, is someone who could be proactive, forward-thinking, and solve problems, both technical and musical, before they came up.""
 Work Life
 Most composers work in a home or external studio, where they're joined by a team that may be as small as one other person (their assistant) or as large as ten employees with different professional specialties. Aspiring assistants should expect early mornings, late nights, and long hours, especially when a deadline is approaching.

Backup Dancer (Concerts and Tours),53120,"Acting, Theatre & Dance","backup, concert, tour, dance, travel, team, ","? Known for their flexible skill set, excellent technique, tireless stamina, and copious live performance experience, backup dancers support major recording artists in concerts, tours, and music videos. In this gig-based field, there are opportunities for performers from a range of backgrounds to find work: from highly educated dancers who have trained since birth, to relative newcomers scouted from clubs and universities. However, that's not to suggest that this business is forgiving; the world of background dance is fast-paced and competitive, and those who make it their career must work tirelessly to keep up.
 
 While beginners might get away with substituting charisma and appeal for dedicated training, anyone hoping for a long-term career as a backup dancer must thoroughly learn the four critical dance styles: ballet, hip-hop, jazz, and modern. Once they've mastered those, backup dancers are always on the lookout for something to gain an edge over the competition, be it a difficult move, a particular movement style like tap or mime, or a highly complementary skill like acting or singing. In fact, almost all of a backup dancer's time while not working is spent taking classes to learn new techniques, practicing to keep up their skills, and working out to stay in shape. Professional development is constant, lest backup dancers risk falling behind.

 Career Path
 Backup dancers have a wide range of backgrounds and aspirations. Some train their whole lives, while others discover dance as young adults. Some see backup dance as a way to pay the bills, while others are aiming for the limelight, seeking to emulate the backup-dancer-turned-star trajectory charted by people like Jennifer Lopez. A number cross over from working as theatrical ensemble dancers. Regardless, all but the luckiest dancers must start by proving themselves in the battle royale of open auditions. Those who land gigs and perform well gain access to new opportunities and connections, until eventually they spend more time in closed auditions than open ones. Inevitably, the best of the best rise to the top; dancers who form a bond of trust with a specific recording artist might become dance captains a position prized for its security in this gig-based field while those who prefer to remain free agents might become highly sought-after performers and even celebrities in their own right.
 
 It must be said that even the most successful backup dance careers end eventually. The job is highly taxing on the body, leading most professional dancers to move away from performance by their forties, if not sooner. After retiring from performance, dancers might reinvent themselves as choreographers, form their own dance companies, or shift toward careers as dance teachers, movement coaches, physical therapists, or dance therapists. Additionally, those with high-profile careers and large followings might move into the entertainment industry, becoming actors or media personalities.
 
 Finding Work
 Auditions are the sole way to get hired as a backup dancer, and they come in two varieties: open, which means accessible to all and therefore crowded and time-consuming; and closed, which means only for those with solid connections or a great reputation. Stamina, cleverness, and charm are key in open auditions, in which backup dancers seek to distinguish themselves over the course of as many as three 10-hour days. Websites like Backstage(Opens in a new window) can be useful for finding open auditions.
 
 In addition to putting their all into mastering the art of the audition particularly the ability to quickly learn and perform new choreography aspiring backup dancers should create a portfolio or website with videos that showcase their work, build a detailed dance r sum , and get headshots and full-body photographs taken. Networking is another major tool; one never knows when another dancer might pass along an audition, or even choose their own replacement when forced to drop out of a gig. Finally, an excellent agent or agency can help dancers to negotiate contracts, find auditions, and get paid properly after a gig. Like everything else in this field, partnering with an agency generally requires you guessed it more auditions.

 Interpersonal Skills
 Backup dancers are in many ways defined by their flexibility, curiosity, and persistence. Constantly learning new skills and improving old ones in order to broaden their capabilities and be more appealing to choreographers, backup dancers rarely sit idle. Of course, they must have an excellent sense of rhythm, flawless technique, and an intuitive ability to synchronize with other performers, but all of this is useless if backup dancers can't take direction and make quick adjustments based on the choreographer's feedback. Finally, this is a career in which attitude and style are really important if two dancers are equal in skill, then the choreographer will probably take the one whose style suits the video, who really sells their dance moves with energy or enthusiasm, or who simply seems like a more pleasant partner for a long rehearsal, tour, or shoot.
 
 Work Life
 Most backup dancers are freelancers who split their time between the road and wherever they call home most often Los Angeles or New York City. Touring is divisive: a major career perk for some, who relish the opportunity to see faraway places, while a serious downside for others, who dislike the lifestyle it entails. When not touring, most backup dancers take on one-time gigs, which come in at all hours of the day and often have a quick turnaround. This includes everything from concert and club gigs to music video and advertising shoots, and even some live events like weddings. What little free time dancers have is usually spent learning new skills and training to stay sharp, flexible, and strong. A proper training regimen can lengthen a backup dancer's career significantly, but it will never entirely prevent injuries making it that much more important for dancers to secure an alternative source of income.",https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/backup-dancer-concerts-and-tours
Backup Singer,51122,Musicians and Singers,"backup singer, travel, band, performance, live","? Although many never step into the spotlight as recording artists, backup singers are among the most nimble, consistent, and skilled vocalists out there. Whether they're working in the studio as session musicians, supporting an artist on tour as touring musicians, or providing vocals for an advertisement, video game soundtrack, television broadcast, or film score, backup singers bring professionalism and versatility to the job. Most are freelancers hired by an artist, producer, recording engineer, or music director, and may choose to take on both studio and live work or focus their career on one area.
 
 In the studio, backup singers usually known as session singers are trusted for their ability to walk into a recording studio, look over a piece of sheet music, and nail a part on the first take with little or no rehearsal. They're also known for their flexibility, providing vocals to artists and tracks across many different genres and shifting vocal style on request. In the course of a week, a session singer might work on a hip-hop track, sing on a jazz record, and do harmonies for a pop-country hit.
 
 Live performing backup singers assist artists on tour, at special concerts and festivals, and during television broadcasts, bringing layered studio harmonies to life. If they're working with a pop star, live backup singers may learn and perform choreography as part of the job. In each setting, backup singers are expected to perfectly complement but never overshadow the lead singer sometimes providing contrasting textures to the lead vocal, and sometimes precisely matching the singer's tone, personality, rhythm, phrasing, and accent. The bottom line? Backup singers are vocal chameleons.
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Session singers are usually conservatory or university trained, as the job requires excellent sight-reading and harmonizing skills and a keen understanding of vocal technique. A session singer might start out providing vocals for demo tracks by songwriter-producers before being hired to do session vocals for a full studio recording. On the other hand, live backup singers often start out as singers in original bands and other live performance projects before being scouted as backup singers for large pop acts.
 
 Building a reputation as a skilled and reliable vocalist leads to more referrals and gigs with more prestigious artists. Skilled session singers with improvisation and songwriting abilities can go on to become top-line songwriters, while those interested in sharing their hard-won technical knowledge and experience could become vocal coaches. Some backup singers also go on to find success as solo or recording artists.
 
 Finding Work
 As with many freelance jobs in the music industry, starting out as a backup singer involves networking and cultivating relationships with people who can provide that first big break: other singers, producers, arrangers, music directors, and music contractors. Session singers should record a demo reel to showcase their vocal talent and stylistic flexibility, and be ready to sing anytime.

Responding quickly and effectively to direction from the producer or vocal arranger is also critical.
 
 Work Life
 As freelancers, backup singers choose which gigs to pick up, and usually work at local studios. While most sessions, performances, and tours are scheduled well in advance, it's not unusual for a call to come in at 11:00 p.m. for a session the following morning. Backup singers who accompany artists on tour could be away from home for some time, depending on the length of the tour.",https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/session-singer
Bandleader,51122,Directors and Supervisors,"bandleader, band, conduct, arrange, compose, perform","? Imagine a conductor who drops the baton and plays alongside the band, and youÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ­ve begun to understand what a bandleader does. Bandleaders are talented performers who bring together musicians for a band or ensemble, select or create material for them, shape the musicÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ­s dynamics, phrasing, and expression in rehearsals, and lead the group in performance while playing alongside them.
 
 This position has evolved greatly since the time of early ""big band"" bandleaders like Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, and Count Basie. While some contemporary bandleaders like Kamasi Washington or Brian Blade keep the old tradition alive, composing and arranging pieces for groups of musicians they've chosen, other bandleaders work in an entirely different way. Some work for famous recording artists, selecting musicians to form their touring band and ensuring that they're ready to perform the arrangements. Others are selected from within large, established bands for this leadership position, or inherit an ensemble that's lost its direction. Still others work in the television industry, leading house bands on late-night talk shows.
 
 While bandleading is mostly about selecting players and leading them musically, bandleaders sometimes take on additional logistical responsibilities for their groups, including booking live or studio gigs, scheduling studio time, preparing music, hiring and paying advisors like business managers or entertainment attorneys, and corresponding with a record label or management team. Bandleaders also frequently handle the emotional and interpersonal dynamics of their players smoothing over conflicts and ensuring that the music comes first.
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 There are no strict educational requirements for bandleaders, who almost universally start out as instrumental performers, honing their chops as touring musicians, session musicians, freelance musicians, orchestra members, pit band players, cruise ship musicians, or even recording artists. This is a pivotal part of most bandleaders' careers, as it's when they make musical connections with their peers and frequent collaborators and learn to communicate with and organize other musicians.
 
 Bandleaders frequently go on to become music directors, who fulfill a very similar role with bands and orchestras, but are less likely to play alongside them and more likely to provide arrangements and in-house production. Musicians who are picked to play as members of a talk show band on television may go on to become television bandleaders, a variety of music director. Other bandleaders like Wynton Marsalis might become the music director for a big band or orchestra, or even the creative director of a larger music performance organization.
 
 Finding Work
 Like many performing musicians, bandleaders find work by proving themselves during performances, crafting a solid reputation for organizing and leading other musicians, and using social media, newsletters, and a website to self-promote. The ability to network is important for career advancement. Bandleaders who put together their own musical ensembles don't usually have employers in the traditional sense, but can use grants as a means to generate funding.

Deep musical skill and creativity are of course a must, but equally important is the ability to identify exactly what the music and the players need to be at their best. Shaping the music requires careful attention to detail, but performing and dealing with last-minute changes and mishaps requires flexibility and spontaneity. Perhaps most of all, bandleaders need to be excellent communicators. Although it's unlikely to show up in any job description, a little emotional intelligence and tact can go a long way towards keeping a group together.
 
 Work Life
 The life of a bandleader is full of opportunities and difficult to define. Touring, recording in the studio, working a steady gig on a TV show, or playing a different local venue each night are all options on the table. The only guarantee for bandleaders is that wherever they go, they won't be alone a priceless blessing, if the bandleader chooses his or her musicians well.",https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/band-leader
Business Manager (Music or Theater Group),52119,Music Business & Management,"business, manager, theatre, band,","What does a Business Manager (Music or Theater Group) do?
 Business managers are often referred to as ""controllers."" It's an apt title, considering that when it comes to an organization's financial resources, business managers control almost everything. Usually working for larger ensemble groups like orchestras and theater companies, business managers are the heads of their organization's business department, and may have their own assistants and staff. They have many duties, including devising and implementing a general budget, distributing payroll, paying outside bills (and reviewing them for discrepancies), and maintaining meticulous financial records. Business managers might also be involved in preparing an organization's tax information and reporting it to the government.
 Business managers are frugal individuals, capable of honestly appraising which of the organization's expenses are totally necessary and which are ripe for reduction.
 When it comes to payroll, it's not the permanent performers and staff that business managers really need to worry about. Instead, what makes payroll challenging is keeping track of payments to all of the outside soloists, guest conductors, outside actors, commissioned composers or playwrights, and contracted technicians who have contributed to the organization. Business managers tend to work closely with the organization's managing director while designing the yearly budget, a difficult task that requires extensive experience in similar roles. Business managers may also collaborate with other department heads, including the head of development, who might set fundraising goals based on the business manager's advice.

 Career Path
 Business managers often start out as assistants, interns, or entry-level employees in an orchestra or theater company's business department. They are often musicians or actors themselves who want to stay involved with music or theater while supplementing their performance income.

Cantor,51122,Music Business & Management,"cantor, church, liturgy, liturgical, choir, director, tradition,","? While the term also applies to the chief singer or choir director at a Christian worship service, as a profession, cantor generally refers to the inspiring and multifaceted singers who lead the Jewish congregation in song and prayer. The Jewish cantor is a complex spiritual leadership position that involves organizing the synagogue's music programs, educating new members of the congregation and converts to Judaism on Torah reading and ritual, working with current members to prepare for major life events, and officiating said events when the time comes.
 
 Cantors truly are involved with the congregation through every major life event; this includes the devastating as well as the joyous.
 
 For over a thousand years, the hallmark of a good cantor has been the combination of an attractive and powerful voice with an emotive and impassioned performance style. Today, however, cantors do more than sing and lead prayers; they are ordained clergy who preside over a host of life events including weddings, funerals, bar and bat mitzvahs, brises, and baby-naming ceremonies. They are also professional educators, helping members of the congregation prepare for their own part in major life ceremonies, teaching conversion students various aspects of the faith, and running the synagogue's music programs. As spiritual leaders, cantors sometimes work directly with the rabbi to make important decisions about the future of the congregation.

 Career Path
 Working as a cantor requires a master's degree in sacred music from a seminary institution, of which there are two major ones in the United States: the Hebrew Union College(Opens in a new window) (reform) and the Jewish Theological Seminary(Opens in a new window) (conservative). These programs typically take about five years, and thoroughly prepare students for lifelong careers as cantors. After graduation, graduates generally begin working as full-fledged cantors for small, local congregations, or as assistant or associate cantors for larger, city-based ones.
 
 More experienced cantors might find work with larger congregations, which are usually better funded, and where they may have their own associate cantors assisting with day-to-day clergy work. With assistants taking care of administrative work, seasoned cantors may be able to turn their focus to more specialized and creative tasks, like theological research, music composition, and new educational initiatives.
 
 Finding Work
 Getting accepted to a sacred music program at a seminary is the first step to finding work as a cantor. These institutions are highly selective, sometimes taking as few as five students a year. In preparation, applicants should do whatever they can to tangibly demonstrate the depth of their faith, liturgical knowledge, and passion for education. Once accepted to a program, aspiring cantors begin to lay the groundwork for their careers by working as volunteers or assistants in their local religious school, becoming soloists in a temple choir, serving as cantorial interns at a synagogue, or interviewing professional cantors in the area to get a sense of where positions might be available.

 Work Life
 Cantors usually work six days per week, including Friday nights, Saturday and Sunday mornings, and all major religious holidays. As pastoral caregivers, they are sometimes called upon to serve individuals in their community outside of work hours, whether that means making a typical social call, paying a visit to a hospitalized congregation member, or providing emotional support in the wake of an unexpected tragedy.

Choreographer,51120,"Acting, Theatre & Dance","choreographer, dance, movement, dancers, teach, costume, makeup, ","What does a Choreographer do?
 In any performance or production that features stylized movement or dance, it's likely that a choreographer is involved. Choreographers work in many different settings: with professional dancers in companies; with directors, actors, or singers in theater, film, and opera; and with producers of live events. On some projects, a choreographer may work mostly alone, creating a sequence of movement based on their own vision. On others, the choreographer must help realize the vision of a director or production team, a process that that is highly collaborative and sometimes challenging. Either way, the primary job of a choreographer is to create powerful, evocative, and communicative movement sequences. The secondary job, no less important, is to communicate these movements to the movers (dancers, actors, etc.), and, in some cases, work directly with them as a movement coach, shaping the performance.
 Because this is a highly interdisciplinary role, choreographers have to be fluent in a number of artistic disciplines. In the process of their work, they will likely collaborate with dance, theater, and film designers in the costume, set, and lighting departments. They may also need to choreograph movement to match the work of a specific composer or artist, a skill that requires a nuanced understanding of and strong relationship with music.

 Career Path
 Many choreographers have a bachelor's degree in dance, although a master's degree is often necessary to teach at a university level. Choreographers often begin their careers as professional dancers, working as an assistant choreographer or in similar position whenever possible. After they've gained some experience teaching movements to dancers, aspiring choreographers may begin working as associate choreographers, contributing their own movements to collaborative pieces or creating entire movement pieces independently. They may also be credited as dance directors on pieces without original movements (i.e., pre-existing dance pieces). Some choreographers go on to become creative directors of dance companies or similar institutions. A number also become dance professors or movement coaches.
 Finding Work
 Anywhere there's an artistic production that needs dance or movement, there's work for a freelance choreographer. Finding that work is often a matter of building strong relationships with local performing groups and developing a reputation as an effective choreographer. There are also often in-house positions for choreographers at dance companies and teaching positions at dance schools.

 Being a choreographer isn't just about being a trained dancer. Choreographers must have excellent teaching, communication, collaboration, and leadership skills.

A certain level of artistic vision is essential, as high-level choreographers may not have the opportunity to see their movement performed by dancers until it's too late to change it.
 Work Life
 As a freelance choreographer, flexibility and adaptability are crucial. Projects rarely come when it's convenient, often arriving in bursts, so freelance choreographers may need to pace themselves financially and artistically through slimmer seasons and be ready to throw themselves into the work when it arrives. They may have to work part-time jobs to make ends meet, especially at the beginning of their careers. In-house choreographers, on the other hand, generally have regular schedules and a more stable financial situation.

Church Musician,51122,Musicians and Singers,"church, service, perform, bible, gospel, praise, holy","? While many people who think of church music may picture a choir singing from a balcony, the truth is that there are as many ways to incorporate music into worship as there are to practice Christianity. Some churches stay close to their religious musical traditions, employing organists to accompany sermons and lead the congregation or choir in hymns. Others construct eclectic church bands, which might play original compositions in contemporary or experimental genres for the church community. One thing is for certain: any Christian who's interested in expressing or channeling their faith through music can find a place in this diverse and growing field.
 
 Organists also called keyboardists, pianists, and accompanists are leaders in the churchÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ­s music department who may be tasked with recruiting and training members of the worship team, choosing and arranging music for worship services, and accompanying the pastor. Mainly working with hymnal and choral music, organists have a deep well of Christian musical tradition to draw upon. Depending on the size and budget of the church's music department, the church music director may fill the role of organist.
 
 Church bands, on the other hand, are stylistically and instrumentally diverse groups that are as likely to play rock 'n' roll, hip-hop, R&B, or reggae as they are to play hymnal and gospel music. While some churches stick to the rock/gospel instrumentation established in the 60s and 70s guitar, bass, and drums and ask their bands to play arrangements of classic hymns, many churches encourage band members to create their own faith-based compositions and explore the different ways that music can serve as praise to God.
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Both organists and church band members can become worship leaders, which means an increased focus on organizing rehearsals, selecting music, and leading the congregation. Experienced church musicians can also become church music directors, taking charge of a church's entire musical operation. Church musicians also frequently use their experience working with members of the congregation to enter the field of education, working for schools or creating community music programs.

 Church musician positions are easy enough to find, as they're posted online with great frequency. The hard thing is finding one nearby whose worship tradition and musical style both suit the applicant, and which can pay a living wage. Aspiring church musicians should start by reaching out to a local church to see if they need musicians. Even if they donÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ­t, the pastor may know of other churches nearby that do, and can likely provide a clearer picture of what opportunities are available in the area.

The ideal church musician is also an involved member of the church community, whose excellent communication and education skills make others feel at ease and excited about music.
 
 Work Life
 While church musicians are not necessarily expected to be actively religious, or to follow the same sect of Christianity as the church they play for, most are active members of the congregation and community who perform this role as a side gig. Generally, church musicians live near the churches for which they play, and combine this part-time position with other jobs (as a general business musician, for example) to pay the bills.",https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/church-musician
College Marketing Representative,52119,Music Business & Management,"college marketing representative, market, advertisement, promotion","What does a College Marketing Representative do?
 The most successful record labels might have huge marketing departments and massive budgets, but when it comes to promoting music among the 18 ¬to-25 crowd, a single college student deeply immersed in the local environment and culture can do what ten marketing professionals-working in an office a world away-can't. College marketing representatives are record labels' eyes, ears, and legs on campus. They help create and implement social media marketing campaigns; physical marketing campaigns (e.g., posters, listening events, and merchandising handouts); work with student clubs, radio stations, and local coffee shops and record stores to promote artists; and, of course, publicize on-campus shows.
 College marketing representatives are passionate about consuming and sharing music, and are deeply connected to local music scenes and the listeners that drive them.
 Working as part-timers or interns, college marketing representatives usually answer to a marketing manager, who assigns projects and tasks such as promoting a touring artist who's making a stop nearby, creating buzz for an album release party, or reaching out to a college radio station to find more airplay for a new single. The value of this specific demographic to record labels-and of a connected and hardworking college representative whose efforts fill rooms and turn ears-cannot be overstated.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 For music-oriented college students with an interest in music marketing, concert promotion, radio promotion, or the record industry in general, there are few better ways to jump-start a career. Top college marketing representatives are frequently hired by labels right out of school as marketing reps. Those who aren't hired immediately can leverage their experience to find positions at local labels, radio stations, performance venues, or even concert promotion companies. Whatever direction one takes, college marketing internships are sure to provide a valuable leg up for motivated students.
 Finding Work
 Record labels strongly prefer candidates who show initiative about working in and around music promotion and marketing. Prior experience working with a major campus venue, a campus radio station, or a similar setting can set some candidates above the rest of the pack. These positions are often posted on record label websites and job posting websites, but aspirants shouldn't be afraid to contact record labels directly and make a case for why they should be given an internship-this demonstrates ambition and resourcefulness.

 College marketing representatives are passionate about consuming and sharing music, and are deeply connected to local music scenes and the listeners that drive them. This is a job in which connections make all the difference, so the ideal representative will be outgoing, communicative, and fearless, capable of making valuable connections at the bar after shows just as easily as at dedicated networking events. Representatives must also be independent workers who manage their time well, balancing job duties with schoolwork.
 Work Life
 Most college marketing representatives live and attend university in a major city, which gives them access to a number of major music venues. While they may attend a monthly meeting at one of the record label's local offices, most assignments are given remotely over email. Marketing internships generally require 10 to 12 hours of work per week, but successful representatives might invest much more time and energy in pursuit of valuable industry connections.

Composer (Concert and Stage),51121,"Composition, Scoring, and Songwriting","composer (concert and stage), creative, expression, pieces, purpose, instruments, maestro, computer","What does a Composer (Concert and Stage) do?
 Derived from a Latin word meaning ""one who puts together,"" a composer does just that, piecing together the various elements that comprise a piece of music-melodies and harmonies, rhythms and dynamics, structure and sensibility-to create an original work. Composers may have highly individual styles, methods, and goals, but all composers have one thing in common: they use music as a medium to express and evoke ideas, emotions, and sensibilities.
 Some composers work by ear, but the majority have advanced training in music notation and full command of music theory and contemporary techniques, whether or not they choose to work within established frameworks. Composers may write for voices as well as for instruments, and might incorporate or rely entirely on electronic and digital music tools. A finished work could be as simple as a solo clarinet melody or as lush as a full-length symphony.
 While new work may be purely a product of a composer's urge to create, most professional composers also work on commission, at the behest of a performance group, arts organization, or individual. Jacqueline Kennedy, for example, famously commissioned Leonard Bernstein to write a Mass for the opening of a performing arts center in Washington, D.C. Composers may also work within a composer-in-residence arrangement with an ensemble or other performance group, developing new work exclusively for that group to premiere.

 Career Path
 Some say that concert and stage composition is more art than career; the truth is that it is both, and there is far more than a single way to approach this field. Most concert composers begin by completing an undergraduate music program, after which they might set out into the world to work professionally, seek a mentorship or residency with a prominent composer or orchestra (many of which are located in Europe), or continue into higher education to obtain a master's degree, Ph.D., or D.M.A.
 Whatever path they take, almost all concert composers will eventually need a day job to pay the bills-and, one hopes, to further develop their art and career. Here, those with advanced degrees have a slight advantage, as they can find work as music professors. Others might work as music teachers or tutors, assistant conductors, orchestra members, bandleaders, freelance composers, or concert/event producers-a role which has many benefits for aspiring composers, including helping them get a foothold in the local music community and allowing them to produce their own pieces and ensembles. Finally, there are some aspiring composers who set themselves up as musical freelancers, providing arrangement, orchestration, copyist, and/or transcription services for hire.
 Concert composition is a lifelong pursuit. Experienced composers at the top of their field might take on commissions for prestigious dance and opera companies, and have their pieces performed by prominent orchestras around the world. However, success takes many forms, whether that's a resident spot at the helm of a local jazz ensemble, the opportunity to teach the next generation of composers, or a long career spanning many industries, such as musical theater, film, television, or video games.
 Finding Work
 In order to gain notice and get their work performed, composers might enter their work in national and international contests, seek out composer-in-residence opportunities, become the bandleader for a new or existing ensemble, or even produce their own events. Composers also frequently utilize connections developed during their education and mentorship to get their music seen by music directors and performed by successful orchestras. All said, the path to getting work performed and developing a reputation is paved with numerous collaborations and connections with other composers, musicians, conductors, and live performance professionals.

 Interpersonal Skills
 In one sense, composing is a solitary and consuming endeavor, requiring the ability to set and stick to work hours and to remain comfortable while spending long periods of time working alone. In another sense, however, composing is a highly collaborative art that requires cooperation and communication with a diverse group of musicians, conductors, concert producers, and other composers. The best composers combine these qualities with a deep curiosity about the music around them and a powerful need to communicate something through music.
 Work Life
 The work life of a composer can be as unpredictable as it is creatively rich and rewarding. Throughout their careers, most composers split their time between composition work and a day job-but don't make the mistake of thinking that ""day job"" means menial labor. Popular culture has the tendency to paint artists' day jobs as wholly opposed to creative work, when in reality, the two are often entwined. Composers can work right alongside their artistic peers in jobs like conducting, concert production, audio engineering, arranging, instrumental performance, teaching, or arts administration. Rather than distracting from a composer's challenging creative work, these jobs can lead to valuable collaborations and opportunities. Similarly, one of the benefits of being a composer is that networking often takes place in the concert hall or the coffee shop, swapping ideas with other musicians, composers, and producers.

Composer (Film),51121,"Composition, Scoring, and Songwriting","composer (film), cinema, film study, reflection, movie, , computer","What does a Composer (Film) do?
 If a few screechy violin chords conjure images of a knife, a shower, and a murder, you've experienced the power of a film composer. Bernard Herrmann's 1960 score to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is one of the most famous in movie history and a striking example of the film composer's job: to mirror and heighten action unfolding on screen using the potent language of music.
 Although many film scores are orchestral works rooted in Western classical music, increasingly they are influenced by rock, jazz, folk, blues, world, and electronic music, and use their stylistic palette to illustrate the time period and location in which the film is set; the emotional, psychological, and cinematic mood the director wants to create; and the nuances of story and character playing out on screen.
 The ability to engage in an exchange of ideas is vital for a film composer, as is the humility to ultimately defer and adapt to a director's vision.
 The composer's work typically begins after the film has finished shooting with a series of spotting sessions, when the director, composer, and music editor gather to watch a rough cut of the movie, discuss the score's tone and style, and take detailed notes about which scenes need music, what kind, and how long. In rare cases, a composer will be asked to write a score before the film has been shot, and the spotting process will be performed based on impressions from storyboards or a script.
 Once the precise timing, narrative content, and emotional tone of each music cue has been determined, the composer spends anywhere from two weeks to three months writing the score, which runs roughly half the length of the movie (i.e., an hour of music for a two-hour film). Some composers work by hand with pencil and paper, performing sections of the work in progress for the director on piano. Most, however, use music composition software to create MIDI-based demos of cues, which are then reviewed by the filmmaker and fleshed out by orchestrators.
 When it's time to record the score composers almost always attend the sessions, but aside from that, the extent of their participation depends largely on personal preference and the demands of the score. Some are highly involved in recording sessions, choosing some of the performers beforehand, providing electronic elements of the score in real time, assisting in the booth, and even conducting some cues. Others choose to step away, leaving the recording process in the capable hands of music contractors, instrumental performers, conductors, orchestrators, and recording engineers.

 Career Path
 In the world of stand-alone composers, education is highly valued and careers start late. Not so for today's film composers, who don't necessarily need advanced degrees and often start working professionally shortly after graduating from a conservatory or college. Early in their careers, most film composers try to work on as many projects as possible, stringing together small and low-budget composing opportunities into a larger, upward-trending trajectory. It's a small group of impressively talented, unbelievably hardworking, and enormously lucky composers who manage to make the leap to regularly composing for big-budget films and studios. Film composers at the top of the field develop enduring collaborative relationships with successful directors, enjoy a privileged position within the film industry, and shape the next generation of film composers with their distinctive, iconic scores.
 While working on their own film scoring projects, composers may supplement their income by working as assistants to established composers or as film industry orchestrators, recording or mixing engineers, freelance composers, video game composers, and more. Although creating the music for films can be quite different from composing for a television show-with distinct budgets, needs, obstacles, and work cycles-the career paths are deeply connected. Film composers often write for TV and vice versa, although many find that they prefer composing for one medium over the other.
 Finding Work
 Aspiring film composers should make a point of getting whatever experience they can: working on a student or lower-budget film, for instance, or writing their own score for an already existing film. The ultimate goal is to create a reel that demonstrates an ability to compose cues in a wide range of emotional tones and musical styles. While all work is good work for beginning film composers, they should also carefully consider how to get their name out there; often, this means composing for films that are likely to circulate at festivals. Finally, film composers should be sure to network as a matter of course. Sometimes, getting a ""big break"" is all about connecting with the right people at the right time.

 Filmmaking is a collaborative art. Unlike composers of stand-alone music, who are beholden only to their own muse, film scorers take inspiration from the creative work of writers, actors, cinematographers, and directors. The ability to engage in an exchange of ideas is vital, as is the humility to ultimately defer and adapt to a director's vision. Film composers must also be enthusiastic consumers of film in order to understand the way music can play with and against the action on screen, and to stay on top of changes and trends in the industry. Finally, networking skills are a tremendous strength within this competitive field.
 Work Life
 Usually based out of a home studio, private studio, or office, film composers work in concentrated bursts. Following the comparatively relaxed tempo of the spotting sessions, where the film is screened and decisions are made about tone, style, and cues, the composer works feverishly over the course of several weeks or months to write the score. Less established composers usually spend time hustling for new composing gigs while working an additional job to generate income. A-list composers, on the other hand, often have jobs booked years in advance.

Composer (Musical Theater),51121,"Composition, Scoring, and Songwriting","composer (musical theater), theater, theatre, computer","What does a Composer (Musical Theater) do?
 Musical theater is a blanket term for theatrical performances that feature music as a central element, but it's often used as shorthand for American musical theater-a unique performance tradition which might be described as a partially scored play in which characters sometimes burst into song. Similarly, while many musical theater composers work on musicals that fit right into the American musical theater canon, others create shows that incorporate disparate influences like opera, experimental theater, circus, cabaret, and other musical performance traditions. Additionally, while all musical theater composers have access to a potentially unlimited variety of musical styles, Broadway composers tend to share a common musical influence from the lineage of American musical theater.
 At a basic level, musical theater composers are responsible solely for a show's music. However, many take on additional duties during or after the writing process. Most musical theater composers work with a team including a book writer and lyricist, who are collectively responsible for conceiving the show's story, writing the script, and connecting the story with the music via lyrics. However, some multidisciplinary composer-playwrights-like Lin-Manuel Miranda or Jonathan Larson-take the creative process a step further, overseeing every aspect of a new musical from start to finish: book, lyrics, and music. Additionally, in the final stage of a new show-production-the composer may work with the singers, music director, and orchestrator to ensure that the music is the best it can be. The composer might even make adjustments to the score based on the abilities of the singers, the physical demands of blocking or dance choreography, or the capabilities of the pit orchestra.
 When it comes to the process of writing music, there's just as much variation. For some musical theater composers, a completed song might consist of just a piano sketch with chords, melody, harmony, and rhythm-leaving more elaborate instrumentation to the show's orchestrator. For others, a completed song might be a fully realized score for a specific and intentional set of instruments and voices. Additionally, musical theater composers create music for a wide variety of purposes. Instrumental compositions, for example, might serve to underscore dialogue-heavy scenes, cover up scene changes, highlight an onstage event like a vase shattering, or support ensemble dance numbers. Vocal songs, on the other hand, often aim to advance plot, develop themes, and blow up characters' emotions, struggles, and inner lives for the audience to hear.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Most musical theater composers are experienced, educated musicians with a deep understanding of compositional technique and practice. It's never too early to begin creating or scoring work alongside a book writer or lyricist, but debuting on the professional stage can take time. Before getting their big break, musical theater composers might work as professional songwriters, pit orchestra musicians, theatrical music directors, orchestrators, copyists, arrangers, or assistants to established composers.
 Those whose songs and stories capture audiences' imaginations can become household names with a huge following and tremendous impact on the medium. There's also the booming field of musical theater adaptation, containing numerous opportunities for skilled and flexible composers. Musical theater composers might also work on film, television, or video game scores, write for opera or concert, or contribute to advertisements, businesses, or products as a freelance composer.
 Finding Work
 The theater industry, famously small and tightly knit, runs on networking-a practice which is doubly important for musical theater composers, who need to connect with collaborators like librettists and lyricists as well as career-enablers like producers, directors, and artistic directors if they want to succeed. In addition, prestigious festivals and companies often have opportunities for residencies, and may offer commissions.
 Finally, aspiring musical theater composers should be aware of a wealth of opportunities in a parallel field: composing incidental music and songs for traditional plays. While in many ways it is an entirely different profession and art form, composing for plays can be an opportunity for musical theater composers to grow their professional networks, practice storytelling-oriented composition, and gain experience in a collaborative process.

 Musical theater composers are in many ways defined by their collaborative, adaptable, and interdisciplinary approach to writing music. They're invested in the process of working with other creatives to construct a multifaceted theatrical experience, and understand the creative give-and-take necessary to accomplish this. Musical theater composers enjoy working within the constraints of a story, and excel at writing music that enhances character and narrative. Catchy songwriting is often seen as the trait most necessary for mainstream success.
 Work Life
 New York City and London are the two hotbed locations for this industry. However, there are book writers, lyricists, and small theater companies willing to produce original musicals all over the United States. Musical theater composers typically begin their work after receiving an outline or completed book from a book writer, or after receiving a commission from a producing party. They proceed to develop songs and instrumental music, collaborating with the book writer and a lyricist, if necessary. Following this, the musical might enter an intensive workshopping process wherein the script, music, and lyrics are thoroughly critiqued and revised. Finally, if picked up by a theater company or festival, the show enters production.",https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/composer-musical-theater
Composer (Television),51121,"Composition, Scoring, and Songwriting","composer (television), series, sets, network, cable, computer","What does a Composer (Television) do?
 Like film composers, television composers use the language of music to help tell stories. Whether working on a drama, comedy, sci-fi, documentary, or reality show, the composer's job is to write music that heightens the action playing out on screen and enhances the emotional experience for the viewer.
 While a television composer may be responsible for writing a show's theme-a memorable song or instrumental passage played at the beginning of each episode that evokes the show's mood-their primary responsibility is to write the score for each episode, which is made up of a number of short, discrete pieces called ""cues."" Cues vary in style and tone and are used to highlight specific moments: a car chase, for instance, or a love scene.
 Besides the theme and the score, television composers might also create ""source music,"" music that exists in the world of the show. Source music is much less common than background or themes, and often takes the form of original songs that characters hear played on the radio or performed by fictional bands.
 Composing for television means being deeply attuned to story and character, and skilled enough to translate emotional and psychological nuances into effective musical soundtracks.
 Compared to composing for film, wherein every creative decision is heavily weighed over the course of months, composing for TV is fast-paced and intense. Television shows with hefty production budgets hire composers to write custom scores for each episode, which means creating a tremendous amount of music in a relatively short time span. For half-hour shows a composer might deliver 10 ¬20 minutes of music, while hour-long shows may require 20 ¬40 minutes of music, week in and week out if the show is serialized. As a result of these quick turnarounds, most television composers have a team, including a number of composer's assistants and possibly an orchestrator. Television composers usually answer to producers and/or showrunners, and may also coordinate heavily with music editors. In the recording process, many composers also work as session conductors.
 Not all television music is written by a television composer; many productions opt to license themes and cues from music libraries, which are stocked with music in every style, written by freelance composers. In addition, music supervisors work independently to find and license pre-existing songs for use in their shows.

 Career Path
 While the rise of streaming and explosion of cable and niche networks have created more demand for television music than ever before, the process for becoming a successful TV composer has remained mostly unchanged: work on lower budget series, demonstrate talent and professionalism, network, get a job on a slightly higher-budget show, and so on and so forth until one makes it to the mainstream.
 Although creating the music for a TV show can be quite a different process than composing for film-with distinct budgets, needs, obstacles, and work cycles-the career paths are deeply interlinked. TV composers often write for film and vice versa, although many find that they prefer composing for one medium over the other. TV composers might also work as freelance composers, submitting music to libraries or writing for advertisements, or compose for a different visual medium, such as video games.
 Most TV composers do this job because they want to, not because they're aiming to advance to some other position. That being said, TV composers who do well can open up a number of new opportunities for themselves outside of television, including film gigs or even touring productions based on their work (Game of Thrones and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend are recent examples of this).
 Finding Work
 At the beginning of the career, one should seek to build a portfolio through whatever means necessary. It's common to work for little or no compensation on student films, web series, or similar projects in order to get those initial credits and demonstrate experience with the medium. From there, it's all about chaining together opportunities to maintain momentum. Aspiring composers should aim to create a website with samples of their music; make audio and video demo reels to send to television producers, showrunners, studios, libraries, and music supervisors; and network vigorously.

 Composing for television means being deeply attuned to story and character, and skilled enough to translate emotional and psychological nuances into effective musical soundtracks. In order to advance in the world of television, composers must be excellent networkers and self-marketers. Finally, it's important to be cool-headed, productive, and consistent under pressing deadlines. After all, even if the music doesn't always come easily, the show must go on.
 Work Life
 One of the main benefits of composing for television rather than film is consistency. While a film composer might make a large one-time sum working on a major motion picture, that's no guarantee of future work. In comparison, if a television show does well, then its composer can expect to be employed for a number of years. The flip side is that television production cycles can be grueling; television composers who are composing for broadcast TV spend each season, which typically runs somewhere between 12 and 22 episodes, working very hard under tight, demanding deadlines.
 However, even this is changing rapidly. As giants like Netflix and Amazon bankroll and release entire seasons in one go, television composers today might compose music for the show as a whole rather than week to week. And, of course, the popular practice of binge-watching television-rather than viewing week to week-is also changing the medium, with a new emphasis on creating varied, but thematically cohesive scores. All in all, there's never been a better time to jump into this field.

Composer (Video Games),51121,"Composition, Scoring, and Songwriting","composer (video games), video game, gaming, livestream, streaming, computer","What does a Composer (Video Games) do?
 As video games have grown more complex and immersive, so too have the soundtracks that accompany them. Today, contemporary video game scores can be every bit as dynamic and sophisticated as movie soundtracks-likely because video game composers frequently work on films and television shows and vice versa. Just like film scores, video game scores require dozens of individual pieces of music-called ""cues""-that collectively serve to create a mood, enhance the action and drama playing out on screen, and cultivate a sense of time and place. However, that's where the similarities end; while films and television shows are passive viewing experiences, video games are interactive journeys that require composers to embrace variables unique to game design.
 To get a foot in the door, aspiring composers will need a show reel to send to prospective employers, which means recording a short collection of cues on their own time.
 Unlike movie scores, video game scores must respond seamlessly to different modes of gameplay (e.g., exploration, combat, or problem solving) and react instantly to a player's on-screen maneuvers-swelling in victory the moment a battle is won, for example, or quieting ominously as the player enters stealth mode. Writing music for an interactive framework requires that composers master the creation of rich linear loops, music chunks suitable for resequencing, individual themes for characters, and compositional fragments for use within a generative system (such as in the life-simulation game Spore). Composers who write for top-tier games-referred to as triple-A-may record their scores with full orchestras, while independent developers and smaller titles are likely to use a combination of recorded instruments and samples.

 Career Path
 Besides being excellent composers with advanced training in musical composition, video game composers must have some experience playing or making games to understand the way in which their music will be used. Video game composers who are early in their careers likely need an additional source of income; this could mean working for video game developers in other capacities (e.g., as a sound designer or audio developer), working as a freelance composer, or even becoming the assistant to an established composer. One could also freelance as an orchestrator, copyist, session conductor, or session musician.
 After composing for or contributing music to a number of shipped games, talented and lucky video game composers might begin to receive recognition and enough compensation to drop the side gigs. Skilled video game composers, especially those who demonstrate great flexibility in their compositions, are a hot commodity in the industry. The reward for their hard work is a steady flow of projects from top-tier studios, enabling them to support themselves by doing what they love most-writing music for video games-while contributing to exciting, genre-defining projects.
 Finding Work
 A rapidly growing industry, video gaming is overflowing with opportunity and competition. To get a foot in the door, aspiring composers will need a show reel to send to prospective employers, which means recording a short collection of cues on their own time. Even more valuable, however, is a complete game with a corresponding soundtrack. A show reel can demonstrate one's ability to write engaging compositions, but when it comes to showing off one's ability to create a mood and enhance a story or setting, a game or game demo cannot be beat.
 Aspiring video game composers can kick-start their careers even as undergraduates by getting in touch with game design students or independent studios and contributing to a game soundtrack. They should also keep in mind the myriad cutting-edge opportunities available in mobile gaming, as well as with virtual and augmented reality companies like Magic Leap

They should also be able to work well within a creative team; while composing is a solitary art, it is also-paradoxically-an intensely collaborative one. Finally, because video game composers are generally freelancers, they need tenacity, salesmanship, and networking ability to thrive in this fast-growing and competitive field.

 Most video game composers are independent contractors who work from home studios, either alone or-if well-established and working on a higher budget-alongside a team of assistants. Composers may come into video game studio offices for meetings of the creative team, but for the most part, the work is performed remotely. In-house positions in this industry are rare, but composers who make strong professional connections with a particular studio or team, or who work on the soundtrack for a multi-title franchise, may find themselves working consistently with the same studio.

Concert Hall Marketing Director,52119,Music Business & Management,"concert hall marketing director, advertisement, promotion, ","What does a Concert Hall Marketing Director do?
 A marketing director at a concert hall isn't exactly a publicist, a copywriter, or a social media manager, although the job encompasses aspects of all of these roles. Above all, marketing directors are strategists, responsible for developing and implementing effective methods (both broad and specific) of drawing attention to the venue and its schedule of events. The best marketing directors are well-versed in, and excited by, the arts, and they use this background to design effective new marketing campaigns.
 Promoters need to be as disciplined as they are passionate, able to negotiate intelligently, keep tight control over expenses, and pay careful attention to the myriad details involved in producing a live music event.
 Depending on the size and budget of the concert hall in question, marketing directors may supervise a sizable staff or do much of the legwork themselves. Speaking of legwork, there's a lot of it in marketing: preparing and placing ads in the media; composing news releases; sending email blasts; designing posters and flyers; updating the venue's website and social media accounts; writing and editing newsletters, brochures, and program notes; scheduling interviews for incoming performers with local media; and producing subscription campaigns.
 Marketing directors may also cooperate with the development department, or initiate marketing collaborations with other organizations-a symphony orchestra that has a performance scheduled in the concert hall, for instance, or a local restaurant with which they're partnering for a special event.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 As the head of the marketing department, marketing director is a senior position that requires a solid amount of career experience-five years, minimum. The job has no set-in-stone educational requirements, but a master's degree in marketing can increase one's chances of getting the position. While every marketing career is different, most marketing directors begin their careers as interns or assistants in an arts-oriented marketing environment, learning the ropes firsthand before progressing to become marketing representatives. Marketing is generally a meritocratic field, and those with a necessarily broad skillset and fierce work ethic can advance to become marketing managers and, finally, marketing directors.
 Finding Work
 Aspiring concert hall marketing directors should seek out marketing and development opportunities at concert halls, theaters, clubs, and other performance-oriented spaces. One should keep in mind that many museums and universities have their own performance and event spaces, all of which need skilled marketers.

 Interpersonal Skills
 The ideal marketing director is creative, organized, flexible, and-most importantly-passionate. While one can certainly fake enthusiasm, it's more sustainable-both for the marketer and the marketing-to employ genuine enthusiasm in one's approach to marketing. Additionally, because the world of live performance can be tricky and unpredictable, it is critical that the marketing director can stay cool under pressure and solve problems on a dime.
 Work Life
 Although marketing directors generally work during normal business hours, there's no such thing as a typical day for a marketer; each is spent juggling a dozen things that had to be done yesterday, responding nimbly to last-minute changes and unanticipated delays, and beginning to brainstorm about whatever comes next. Attendance at the concert hall's evening and weekend events is usually expected, while attendance of evening events at other, similar organizations provides an opportunity for networking.

Concert Promoter,52119,Music Business & Management,"concert promoter, advertisement, promotion, social media, ","What does a Concert Promoter do?
 It's easy to confuse the work of concert promoters with that of talent buyers, booking agents, concert producers, and other behind-the-scenes players in the live music business, and for good reason: there's plenty of overlap. But while a talent buyer books performers for the venue where they work and a booking agent represents performers looking to set up live shows, concert promoters aren't affiliated with a venue or an artist. Rather, they independently plan, market, and sometimes produce live concerts, including single shows, tours, festivals, and special events.
 Promoters need to be as disciplined as they are passionate, able to negotiate intelligently, keep tight control over expenses, and pay careful attention to the myriad details involved in producing a live music event.
 For concert promoters, every job begins with budgeting: determining the right amount of money to spend on a concert, tour, or festival in order to maximize returns. Concert promotion is at heart a numbers game, and since promoters assume all of the financial risk for the shows they put on, they have to be sure that the event will be profitable. Success hinges entirely on the promoter's music and market savvy, negotiating skills, and ability to recruit an audience. Once a budget is in place, they might secure performers, pick a venue, and negotiate contracts and fees. Then there's the matter of designing and executing a marketing strategy. Finally, the promoter works with concert/event producers-either in house or third party-to arrange travel, transportation, and lodging for the artist and crew, as well as on-site hospitality; to devise a rider (a set of requests, usually creature comforts) with the artist; and to create a production schedule for load-in, load-out, lighting, and sound. If the event is a festival, the promoter will also hire a festival director and event operations coordinators.
 At its heart, concert promotion is the art of creating an audience for a show and can involve almost anything that has to do with filling seats, such as ticketing and quality control. But if that's concert promotion, then why talk about concert production and booking above? The answer is that most medium- to large-sized concert promotion companies-such as Live Nation or AEG Presents-actually do much, much more than just promotion. It's common for these companies to own and manage a number of venues where they plan, book, produce, and promote their own shows-the whole live event pipeline. In addition, some even manage their own roster of artists. While a few independent concert promoters remain who create and distribute flyers, help plan radio visits, and organize online media campaigns for shows booked and produced by someone else, concert promotion companies focus on planning and organizing events from start to finish. When people talk about concert promoters, they're often talking about employees of these companies, rather than the independent variety.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 The concert-promotion industry is dominated by corporate behemoths like Live Nation and AEG Presents, but small, independent promoters-often operating regionally-have managed to carve out a niche. Most concert promoters start out producing or marketing events, concerts, and festivals at their college or within their local area. Some go on to become interns and assistants at concert-promotion companies, where they can advance within their departments, while others found their own independent companies or simply work as freelancers within the DIY music scene. Success as a concert promoter means having the connections and clout to book bigger acts in nicer venues. The best concert promoters have a solid reputation for creating well-attended, talked-about, and financially successful events.
 Finding Work
 Aspiring concert promoters can get experience by putting on house concerts in their home or at friend's place-handling the booking, ticketing, promotion, and even production. Entry-level jobs and internships are also available at major concert promotion companies like C3 Presents

To succeed, concert promoters must be as disciplined as they are passionate, capable of keeping tight control over expenses. They must also be highly detail-oriented, both while planning and producing live events and while sitting at the negotiation table with artists, agents, and managers.
 Work Life
 Concert promotion is a consuming job, which requires performing business duties-usually out of an office-by day and attending shows at night and on the weekend. Concert promoters are constantly networking with other music business professionals, and constantly searching for up-and-coming artists with momentum and strong fan bases. In the lightning-speed world of social media and viral sensations, concert promoters have to be ready at all times to capitalize on changes in the music community.

Concertmaster,51121,Directors and Supervisors,"concertmaster, leader, principal, performance, first, chair","? Simultaneously the most skilled and knowledgeable violinist of the orchestra while also the chief intermediary between the musicians and the conductor, the concertmaster is responsible for dictating bowings to the first violin section; playing solo passages in the absence of a guest soloist; understanding the conductor's ideas and communicating them in technical terms to the rest of the orchestra; leading the orchestra in tuning before rehearsals and performances; and assisting with aspects of the orchestra's management. While conductors may come and go with differing styles and approaches the concertmaster provides the orchestra with consistent and technically oriented leadership.
 
  In addition to being an excellent player with deep knowledge of orchestra repertoire and fantastic abilities as a soloist, concertmasters must also cultivate superb leadership, teaching, and communication skills.
 
 In addition to her or his regular duties, a concertmaster might assist in the audition and hiring process for principal players, resolve problems artistic, technical, or personal between members of the orchestra, or even work closely with the orchestra's music director as their right-hand person, weighing in on all artistic decisions. The importance of the concertmaster's leadership is not to be underestimated. While performing, the string musicians generally watch the concertmaster nearly as closely as they do the conductor more so in cases where the guest conductor isn't gelling well with the orchestra.
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 The concertmaster is the highest leadership position among all the musicians in the orchestra, second in authority only to the conductor and music director (who may be the same person). Some concertmasters are former soloists who chose to settle down and join an orchestra, although most are dedicated long-term orchestra musicians who have worked their way up the ranks.
 
 Concertmasters are seasoned professionals who are likely to have been through the audition process many times over, toured throughout the world, performed nearly every solo in common orchestra repertoire, and led various violin sections before even earning the position. While concertmasters could go on to become conductors, music directors, or even artistic directors, they're more likely to advance by auditioning for similar positions with more prestigious orchestras.
 
 Finding Work
 The variety of concertmaster described above a violinist who oversees the first string section works as a full-time employee for a symphony orchestra, one per orchestra. Symphony concertmasters typically work their way up to the position after many years with the orchestra and prior leadership positions (e.g. principal second violin).
 
 In a concert band setting, the concertmaster role may be filled by a principal wind instrument player, while in brass bands it may be performed by a highly skilled trumpeter.

 Work Life
 On top of daytime rehearsals and evening performances, concertmasters spend time practicing, meeting with the orchestra's conductor, studying scores, preparing music for orchestra members, and more. Their work life resembles that of any other orchestra member, but with the additional responsibilites of resolving interpersonal problems, meeting with the conductor, and setting an example for the rest of the orchestra meaning they're likely to arrive first for rehearsal and leave last.",https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/concertmasterconcertmistress
Conductor,51121,Directors and Supervisors,"conductor, conduct, arrange, compose, perform, leader, director","? It's a familiar sight: the silent, well-dressed musician at the podium waving a baton to keep time. Yet conductors are much more than timekeepers they're interpreters and leaders who shape and refine every aspect of the performance's sound and, when working at their best, unify the performing group. In fact, most of a conductor's work takes place long before the performance and perhaps even before meeting with the orchestra.
 
 Conductors must be insightful and charismatic capable of inspiring hard work and deep musicality from ensemble members, and able to verbally and nonverbally communicate a vast array of emotions.
 
 When conductors receive the setlist for the next concert or season usually created by the orchestra's music director, when these roles are separate they begin to explore and analyze the music at hand, seeking to understand the composer's vision as well as to interpret the music in their own way. Shortly thereafter, they begin rehearsals with the orchestra: shaping particular and sometimes minute aspects of the performance dynamics, phrasing, timing, and more to better blend the orchestra's sound, promote rhythmic unity, and realize their own interpretation of the piece.
 
 When it comes to performance, conductors typically use a baton to outline tempos and their free hand to indicate entrances and nuances, but some conductors dispense with the baton altogether, freeing both hands and arms for more elaborate interpretive directions. Conductors also use torso movements and facial expressions to convey their wishes for phrasing and dynamics to the ensemble. While some conductors are only there to conduct, others' duties extend far beyond the podium. Orchestra music directors, for example, have broad authority over the ensemble's affairs, including selecting repertoire, overseeing auditions and hiring, and assisting with fundraising and publicity. On the other hand, session conductors who are plentiful in Hollywood work on a freelance basis.

 Career Path
 Generally speaking, conductors are accomplished instrumentalists with significant musical training. Many spend the early part of their careers working as orchestra musicians, although some dive right into conducting. For first professional conducting experiences, it's common to start out with youth and college orchestras, or as an assistant or associate conductor. From there, one might become the principal conductor of a small regional ensemble before finding a position with a more prestigious group. Those who are successful might have their pick of orchestra, while the top conductors could even become international celebrities. Experienced conductors with managerial abilities and a vested interest in their organization might become music directors. 
 
 Finding Work
 Conductors work for and with orchestras, concert bands, choral groups, opera and ballet companies, and schools (as music teachers or professors). Those who aren't the principal conductor or music director for an ensemble are likely freelancers who travel to different orchestras and ensembles across the world as guest conductors, or assist with local orchestras on a part-time basis. Conductors with studio experience can also perform freelance session work, which is plentiful in Hollywood.

 Work Life
 The life of a conductor is varied, including stretches of introspection and solitude while looking over scores, long hours in the rehearsal room working with the orchestra, performances at night, and sometimes a public life as a center-stage performer. If the conductor is a music director, the job might include a slew of additional managerial duties. While established conductors can make a living from their work, conductors who are just getting started might supplement their income by working in music prep as an arranger, orchestrator, copyist, or proofreader or leading recording sessions for film, TV, and video game soundtracks.",https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/conductor
Copyist (Concert and Stage),51121,"Composition, Scoring, and Songwriting","copyist (concert and stage), copies, distribution, performance, concert","What does a Copyist (Concert and Stage) do?
 The copyist is one of several roles involved in the larger field of music preparation. Copyists, who proofread and organize written music for an upcoming studio session or performance, are one of the last in a chain of professionals responsible for creating the finished scores that musicians play.
 Their goal: to create polished and practical sheet music that can be distributed to each member of the orchestra or ensemble, as well as to important figures like the conductor and music director. Copyists prepare music for everyone from members of the musical theater and film industries to record label employees and jazz ensembles.
 Traditionally, the copyist receives the finished master score from an orchestrator, who received a draft, sketch, or outline of the score from the composer. However, this isn't always the case; copyists might also receive scores from transcribers, arrangers, and music directors. Once they have the score, copyists use notation software such as Sibelius and Finale to create, finalize, and bind individual parts for each musician or instrument.
 While much of the job rests on aptitude with the aforementioned software, copyists must also consider various factors while producing the parts, including the location of page turns, how rests are displayed, and-more generally-how the music ´s presentation will affect each musician ´s experience playing it. The scores copyists produce are not used solely by performers but also by sound engineers, recording engineers, and film or music video directors.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 There are no formal educational requirements to work as a copyist, although a deep knowledge of music notation and composition is essential. Copyists are usually self-employed, offering a number of related services to their clients, including proofreading, transcription, orchestration, and arrangement. Some work full-time for music preparation companies, where they perform similar duties. Copyists can also find a wealth of work in the film industry.
 While a small number of copyists make this job their entire career, most are just looking to make some additional income and valuable industry connections while they work another angle; often, this means pursuing a career as a composer, conductor, or music director. Still, those who devote time and energy to their careers as copyists have the opportunity to work with higher-profile artists and composers, and are paid more for it.
 A copyist who truly loves working around and preserving written music might also be interested in a career as a music librarian.
 Finding Work
 Many copyists get their start by apprenticing under a music prep person (usually a copyist, proofreader, arranger, or orchestrator), although some develop the necessary skills by working as composer's assistants. Most copyists work freelance, making it important to develop connections and build a reputation in order to create a steady stream of gigs.

Flexibility is also important, as copyists must sometimes drop the work they ´ve done when a client contacts them with major changes. As this is a freelance career, cultivating networking skills is important.
 Work Life
 Most copyists are freelancers, combining this work with another form of music prep, a regular teaching job, or part-time work in music prep offices, where they may have more consistent hours. Still, very few copyists enjoy a regular schedule. Work comes in at all hours of the day and needs to get done with a very quick turnaround. Rates differ based on industry, but most copyists are paid by the page.

 The copyist is one of several roles involved in the larger field of music preparation. Copyists, who prepare and organize written music for an upcoming session or performance, may also work as or alongside orchestrators, arrangers, proofreaders, transcribers, and music librarians. Copyists usually work freelance, for a music preparation company, or-in rarer cases-as a member of a composer's team.
 After an orchestrator is finished with the film score, its next stop is usually with a copyist. In order to fully prepare for the session, the copyist must proofread the entire score and produce and transpose individual parts for each instrument. In the process, the copyist might make small adjustments to the score, such as adding in measure numbers.
 Copyists do not always perform the physical task of printing and binding the parts themselves; today, they're just as likely to send PDFs off to another professional who will handle that task. Copyists who do print and bind parts take special care to produce full copies for the composer, conductor, music editor, and music publisher. Copyists might also take part in the recording session itself: distributing copies of parts to musicians, keeping track of them throughout the session, and collecting them at the end. Ultimately, a copyist's specific duties depend greatly on the budget and time frame of the project.

 Career Path
 The copyist is one of many roles involved in preparing music for films, TV shows, and video games, and shares a skill set with some others, such as the orchestrator. Copyists can be freelance or employed by a music preparation company. Sometimes, a member of the composer ´s team, such as an assistant, performs the role of copyist.
 While a small number of copyists make this job their entire career, most copyists are just looking to make some additional income and valuable industry connections while they work another angle.
 Finding Work
 Unlike orchestrators, who may be hired directly by the composer, copyists are typically hired by the music contractor, who also hires all of the musicians for a session. As a result, performing musicians have a leg up on finding freelance work as a copyist-they're already connected with music contractors. For more composition-oriented musicians, working as a composer's assistant can provide a necessary introduction to the world of film, TV, and video game recording sessions, and supply the contacts necessary to locate initial gigs. One can also apply for posted positions at music preparation companies-or reach out directly to see if they would be interested in an intern or apprentice. Film and TV copyists might also work gigs in the world of concert and stage music.

 Copyists must be organized, detail-oriented, and cool under pressure. Due to the characteristic quick turnarounds of these industries, copyists will sometimes have to produce completed and error-free cue sheets only a few hours after receiving a score from an orchestrator.
 Work Life
 Copyists who work for music-preparation companies might have a common office space and fairly consistent work hours, but this is the exception to the rule. For freelance copyists, the majority of work is done at home and scheduled around other jobs and endeavors (e.g., sessions as an orchestral musician, gigs as an orchestrator, or performances as part of a band or ensemble). Although this wasn't the case even 10 years ago, today's copyists are expected to be available to work on a score at all hours of the day-even working through the night when necessary.

Cover Band Musician,51122,Musicians and Singers,"cover, musician, style, genre, specific, artist","? Cover bands, which are usually comprised of general business musicians, play sets of songs written by other artists at private events, nightclubs, and bars. While they might not have the recognition or prestige of recording artists, cover bands have something fairly elusive in the live music business: steady work and a built-in audience. Some cover bands have a deep repertoire and can play everything from Elvis to Beyonc , but many specialize in playing songs from a specific musical era, genre, or iconic group. Still others become known for reworking tunes in a particular style, such as the Youtube-famous Postmodern Jukebox, the French group Nouvelle Vague, or the infamous Vitamin String Quartet.
 
 There are many different ways to approach working as a cover band musician. Some musicians might throw together a band of peers to pick up the occasional gig when time allows. For them, this functions as a low-commitment source of income while pursuing other ends trying to get a record contract with an original ensemble, for example. For a number of musicians, however, playing in a cover band represents a full-time, long-term career. Successful and respected cover bands are represented by agencies who negotiate rates, book appearances (sometimes 18 months in advance) and keep their top-shelf players on retainer.
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Most cover band members are professional or freelance musicians, who might also work as touring musicians, session musicians, pit orchestra musicians, cruise ship musicians, military musicians, or church musicians. Many are aspiring to become recording artists, although some just want to make a living playing music. Successful cover bands might be represented by an agency, and become local staples, touring powerhouses, or even successful recording groups.
 
 Highly skilled members of cover bands could be qualified to play in an orchestra or television band, while those with leadership skills and experience could become bandleaders or music directors. Those who are skilled at reinventing compositions for different instrumentations and styles could also become professional arrangers.
 
 Finding Work
 Some cover bands are formed by bandleaders with a particular vision for the band's aesthetic, while others come together naturally from existing groups of friends and collaborators. Established and business-oriented cover bands such as those in a saturated market like Las Vegas frequently audition musicians to fill their ranks.
 
 Top-notch cover bands might work at all kinds of special functions from wedding receptions, birthday parties, and bar mitzvahs to fundraisers, grand openings, and corporate events. Many cover bands become recognizable fixtures at bars, clubs, and lounges, building a local fan base.

Charisma and public speaking skills can go a long way when it comes to warming up cold audiences at special function gigs, who almost definitely aren't there to listen to live music. 
 
 Work Life
 Finding consistent work is the challenge for cover bands, which are paid by the show. Those who don't land ongoing placements at bars or casinos or hire managers and agents to find gigs for them will likely run out of work sooner or later, as there are only so many one-time functions and celebrations to work. Those who only play the occasional one-off gig will need to find day jobs. Working part-time for a music venue or events management company can be an excellent way to secure gigs.",https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/dancecover-band
Creative Entrepreneur,52119,Music Business & Management,"creative entrepreneur, independent, business, artistic, creative","What does a Creative Entrepreneur do?
 Much like the tech entrepreneurs who defined the start of the 21st century, creative entrepreneurs make a living by solving problems-whether that means manufacturing a product that isn ´t available on the market, founding a nonprofit organization to address a social or professional need, or developing an app or website that completely reshapes an industry. What sets creative entrepreneurs apart, however, is their passion for the arts and deep understanding of artistic industries, which are often insular and idiosyncratic-in other words, ripe for disruption. The whole process begins with an idea, honed through a collaborative process and presented to investors in the hopes of securing funding. If successful, the creative entrepreneur can begin the long and challenging process of building a company, taking the reins as its CEO or executive director. Projects can range in scale anywhere from super-local to international, target just about any aspect of the industry, and frequently make use of new technology.
 More than in almost any other artistic industry, creative entrepreneurship is flourishing in the music industry. Startup companies are revolutionizing every aspect of the way artists reach their fans, from music streaming and distribution to social media marketing and merchandising. Long-established powerhouse industries like recording and publishing are being shaken up by democratized recording and production software, experimental artist management solutions, and major improvements to the way rights and royalties are tracked. The same is true for live music, as a fresh crop of companies bring changes to concert promotion and forward-thinking live experience designers bring their vision to the creation of new music festivals. There are also music education companies experimenting with app-based and online learning, instrument and hardware manufacturers who feel they can cut costs or bring something new to the market, and data analytics companies that are proving to be valuable in almost any 21st century endeavor. For a musician or music industry professional with entrepreneurial ambitions, opportunities are almost limitless.

 Career Path
 An entrepreneurial career path takes many forms. Creative entrepreneurs might have a bachelor's, a master's, or no degree at all; they might start building their company at a young age, might land on a powerful idea after several years as artists or arts professionals, or might pass more than ten years in business, software development, or finance before shifting focus to the arts. There is no blueprint, in part because entrepreneurs are measured more by their transferable interpersonal and professional capacities than by the weight of their r sum . Job experience and education are valuable because they help entrepreneurs grow, understand the nuances of their industry, gain access to crucial connections and collaborators, and learn what it means to lead and inspire others, not because of what they represent on a piece of paper. In addition, it's a common experience for young entrepreneurs to find that skills gained from a seemingly unrelated work or education experience become absolutely vital when building their company.
 It may surprise non-entrepreneurs to learn that it's considered normal for beginning entrepreneurs to fail with their first two or three companies. This isn't the red flag it might be taken as in other professions-in fact, it's practically a rite of passage. Those who stick with it, provided they learn from their mistakes, might eventually make their first successful business; this, incidentally, is the ""wall"" that must be overcome at the beginning of almost every entrepreneur's career. Entrepreneurs who manage it will find that subsequent projects benefit from increased investor confidence, accumulated industry connections, and of course all knowledge and experience gained in the meantime. Although seasoned entrepreneurs must still prove themselves each time they start a new project, the process is never as difficult as in the beginning.
 Finding Work
 Part of the beauty of being an entrepreneur is that work isn't usually found-it's created. Rather than beginning with a r sum  and a cover letter, the ""job search"" for a creative entrepreneur begins with an idea: a problem or inefficiency to address and a plan for doing so. Landing on a solid idea can take a lot of time and multiple attempts, but it's only half the battle. From there, entrepreneurs must seek funding, which usually means giving presentations to potential investors or constructing a detailed crowdfunding campaign. If an entrepreneur is struggling to gain traction, he or she might join a business incubator or accelerator: programs that help startups hone their business model and secure investors, sometimes taking a percentage of equity in exchange.

 What sets entrepreneurs apart from non-entrepreneurs is the belief that anything can be improved and an inclination towards action. Entrepreneurs are unafraid to champion unpopular or unheard-of solutions; they go against the grain, test and experiment with new possibilities, and constantly move forward. They are open-minded, resilient, and open to failure. As this is a results-oriented profession, entrepreneurs must also be committed, focused, and flexible, ready to respond to last-minute changes and willing to put in extra work to solve unexpected problems.
 As leaders, entrepreneurs must be deeply attuned to the people around them, just as capable of listening to others' thoughts and needs as of inspiring them with a strong vision. In order to have a successful business, they must clearly understand their own strengths and weaknesses, build trust with their employees, and split the work up effectively. They must also balance very broad, high-level concerns like long-term business strategy with the everyday, minute decision-making that gradually advances the company's interests. Finally, the ability to communicate and work well with artists is essential.
 Work Life
 While entrepreneurs are executives of the companies they create, their work life is completely different from that of a typical CEO. Creative entrepreneurs are driven by results, highly invested in the success of their business, and involved in almost every aspect of decision making. This can lead to an amount of work far exceeding the traditional forty-hour week, as entrepreneurs work on pitching sponsors for increased funding, take care of executive paperwork, oversee the vision of the company, and are involved in decisions about marketing, hiring, product design, manufacturing, and more.
 While starting a business is all-consuming, that doesn't mean an entrepreneur only thinks about a single project at a time, or that projects will follow clean and consistent lifecycles. Ideas are always being exchanged, new collaborators met, and new plans formed. An entrepreneur might work on a concept for a product, set it aside to pursue something different, and then return to the original idea years later. Like the creative process itself, entrepreneurship can be messy and unpredictable-which is also a big part of the appeal.

Cruise Ship Musician,51122,Musicians and Singers,"sight reading, adaptable, adventure, bar, club, cruise, cruise ship musician, entertain, flexible, improvisation, independence, repertoire, sea, sets, travel, ocean, oceans","? Enlisting for tours ranging from four to six months, cruise ship musicians are hard-working players who entertain passengers on luxury liners (i.e. cruise ships). It's demanding work for musicians with the fluency, chops, and stamina to play four excellent sets of covers every night, week in and week out. 
 
 Many cruise ship musicians follow a six-months-on, six-weeks-off schedule, budgeting time to see loved ones and take care of business on land before heading out on another ship. 
 Cruise ships sometimes employ dozens of musicians at a time, placing them in a variety of configurations: solo guitarists and pianists who perform poolside and in bars; classical and contemporary duos; jazz, rock, Latin, and dance ensembles; cover bands that play an array of genres and styles; and pit orchestras for the Broadway-style productions mounted on large, theater-equipped vessels. All or most of the musicians aboard a ship might play simultaneously in different on-board venues, starting after dinner and continuing until the early morning. 
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 While a gig on a cruise ship is unlikely to advance one's career, getting a regular paycheck while incurring few or no expenses is a major draw for freelance musicians, who might join the cruise individually or with a cover band or other ensemble. The job can have a number of perks, including free meals and lodging, round-trip airline travel from home, health insurance for the duration of the cruise, and days spent sunning on the deck or exploring ports.
 
 Finding Work
 There are two ways for musicians to get a job on a cruise ship apply directly through a cruise line, all of which have links for musicians seeking work on their websites, or through a recruitment agency such as Warshaw Entertainment(Opens in a new window), Lime Entertainment(Opens in a new window), Proship(Opens in a new window), or Landau Music(Opens in a new window). The audition process is nothing to scoff at; one blogger describes having music emailed to him thirty minutes before a two-hour Skype audition, during which he was asked to play and improvise in a variety of styles.

 Work Life
 The lifestyle is perhaps the most distinctive thing about working as a cruise ship musician. Cruise ship musicians enjoy many perks, such as a regular paycheck, low expenses, and the opportunity to travel while playing music. But just like touring musicians, they also make sacrifices: spending long stretches away from loved ones, living in close quarters with strangers, and only getting one night off per week. Most cruise ship musicians follow a six-months-on, six-weeks-off schedule. For those not suited to it, life at sea can be isolating, depressing, or overwhelming. But those well suited to it may come to love the camaraderie that develops between the musicians and other crew members during a long voyage.",https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/cruise-ship-musician
Dance Teacher,51122,Music Education,"dance, teacher, body, movement, instructor, education","What does a Dance Teacher do?
 Dance teachers educate their students in the technique, performance, and choreography of dance. Some teachers focus their approach on a single style while others work in many forms, among them ballet, jazz, modern, tap, ballroom, swing, salsa, hip-hop, folk, pole dancing, and traditional dance forms from around the world. Dance teachers work in a number of settings, from schools and private studios to community centers and gyms, and with an equally wide variety of students, from young children to elite professionals in premier companies. Most teachers are themselves dancers and/or choreographers, and bring great knowledge and passion to their work.
 Success as a dance teacher can come in many forms: opening one's own private studio, cultivating a fantastic public school dance program, or working for a prestigious conservatory or dance company.
 While the specific activities and approaches employed by dance teachers vary greatly depending on the style and setting in which they teach, most classes involve some combination of warm-up exercises, technique-based drills, learning or practicing choreography, and rehearsing for performance. Classes may also include the opportunity for students to develop their own choreography, workshop each other's pieces, or practice improvisation. Dance teachers who work in early childhood education may incorporate dance techniques in playtime activities, aiming to develop fundamental aspects of rhythm and movement.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Most dance teachers are experienced dancers or choreographers who specialize in one to three particular styles. They may become teachers after ending their professional careers or continue the two simultaneously as teaching artists. Most public and private schools require their dance teachers to have a bachelor's degree in dance as well as a teaching certification, while university-level dance teachers are expected to have an MFA degree.
 Success as a dance teacher can come in many forms: opening one's own private studio, cultivating a fantastic public school dance program, or working for a prestigious conservatory or dance company. Dance teachers might also choose to work with nonprofit organizations as nonprofit artists, or acquire additional training and education to become dance therapists.
 Finding Work
 Dance teachers work in a wide range of settings, including public schools, private schools, dance academies, conservatories, universities, private dance studios, health clubs, gyms, and cruise ships. Many dance studios require teachers to carry dance insurance coverage or dance fitness liability insurance, while health clubs and gyms generally require a fitness trainer certification. Those who teach as part of a nonprofit organization are likely to work in non-traditional settings, such as hospitals, prisons, community centers, homeless shelters, and rehabilitation centers.

 Work Life
 In addition to working on their feet in the classroom, dance teachers also spend time preparing for classes, observing and tracking the progress of students, and training and acquiring new skills. The majority lead elastic work lives based around part-time teaching gigs in multiple settings-a flexible schedule that can leave room for personal projects and continuing work as a professional dancer or choreographer. Others prefer the stability and consistency of rarer full-time positions, which can be found at universities, conservatories, and private studios.

The power of structured movement like dance to aid physical rehabilitation and improve coordination, strength, and health is well known. However, few are aware that dance and movement activities can also improve psychological, emotional, and behavioral health. Dance therapists work on the understanding that the body and mind are deeply connected, and utilize this connection both to assess and treat their patients.
 Working as a dance therapist generally requires an undergraduate degree, in addition to a master's degree or post-graduate program approved by the American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA).

Dancer,53120,"Acting, Theatre & Dance","dance, body, choreography, coordination, movement, sport","? Said to be ""the athletes of God,"" dancers are performers who use their bodies along with choreographed sequences of movement as instruments of expression. Dance training typically begins in childhood or adolescence and concentrates on improving dancers' flexibility, coordination, athleticism, rhythm, and musicality. Dancers are often initially instructed in a particular style or genre of dance, like ballet, modern, jazz, tap, or hip-hop. Later on, as professionals, they might choose one or two of these styles to specialize in a decision that can have a great impact on their career. Although there are many things that bind all dancers together regardless of genre, dancers can have very particular training routines, repertoires, and career paths based on their specialization. Ballet, for example, is a lifelong study and career in and of itself.
 
 Some dancers work as concert dancers, and perform on stage as the main attraction. Others find a place in the theater world, performing rigorous dance parts in musical theater or opera productions. Many West Coast dancers are employed by the film and television industries, where they appear in movies, TV shows, and music videos. Still others perform in the live music and event industries, supporting popular musicians in tours or participating in staged variety events. At some point in their careers, most dancers also work in some capacity as choreographers or teachers.
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Dancers begin their training at a very young age. Many study dance for their undergraduate degree, and some (especially those interested in teaching) pursue an M.F.A. as well. After becoming professionals, many dancers find in-house positions with concert dance companies and schools. A smaller number become freelancers, working in film, television, live music, and theatrical productions.
 
 Dancers who work in-house typically aim to advance within their organization, becoming senior dancers, section leaders, choreographers, or even artistic directors. Freelance dancers seek to form professional relationships with organizations and groups that lead to steady work and advancement opportunities. 
 
 Finding Work
 Most dancers find work as performers, teachers, or a mix of both. Most teaching positions are with dance schools, colleges, or afterschool programs. For freelance dancers, making a living can require some hustle, especially at the beginning. This could mean cold-emailing or cold-calling local dance groups to see if they need someone to fill in, auditioning for longer projects like national tours, or cobbling together small gigs and collaborations (student films, local events, etc.) to see what sticks. Dancers can also apply for artistic grants to fund new projects. The field of dance is competitive, but getting noticed by a single choreographer, dance director, casting director, or sponsor could mean a wealth of new opportunities.

 Work Life
 To dancers, their bodies are their livelihood. To ensure peak performance and lower the chance of injury, dancers should maintain a high level of physical fitness, engage in daily dance training, practice healthy eating, maintain a regular sleep schedule, and monitor their mental and emotional health.

Development Associate,52119,Music Business & Management,"development associate, fundraising, donations, social, relationships, connections","What does a Development Associate do?
 Development-also known as fundraising or institutional advancement-is essential to the life and goals of any nonprofit organization. It's how these vital institutions acquire the funds to make repairs, improvements, and expansions, or simply to continue operating. Skilled communicators and analysts, development associates work in a variety of ways to generate financial resources for their organizations. Some job duties include the following:
 Writing fundraising appeals and acknowledgment letters
 Processing donations and entering fundraising data into the department ´s database of choice
 Researching and applying for grant opportunities
 Coordinating and planning cultivation and fundraising events
 Managing volunteers at events
 Performing prospect research and analysis
 Cultivating individual donors through phone follow-ups and in-person conversations
 A development associate at a smaller organization might be involved in every aspect of the organization's development activities. At larger organizations, however, the development department tends to be broken into several distinct tracks: institutional giving (i.e., grants); individual giving (i.e., donors); event planning; database management and analysis; and prospect research.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 This is an entry-level position in the development department; as such, it generally requires a bachelor's degree but no further career-specific knowledge. Should they choose to remain in the same field, development associates (also called development representatives or officers) typically enjoy a clearly indicated career progression. A development associate who consistently gets good results can usually expect a promotion to a more specialized position-such as event coordinator or grant writer-within the first two years. From there, employees of large organizations can aim to become the head of their track (e.g. special events manager or grants manager).
 Eventually, the most successful and experienced development workers can ascend to the highest position in the department: the chief development officer, also known as the director of development. Transition to this role might require an MBA or other advanced degree. Experienced development professionals with great connections and networking skills might also become freelance fundraising consultants. Finally, development associates can use their skills to seek positions in other fields. For example, associates whose favorite part of the job is organizing events, parties, and concerts might start a career in event production or operations.
 Finding Work
 Both experience within the field and strong writing skills are unquestionably valuable to employers, but in a job about sharing and eliciting enthusiasm for an organization, there's no substitute for passionate belief in the organization's importance. Aspiring development associates should start by researching local nonprofits to find one they feel excited about, and then check for open positions. Even if no openings are posted, it's often worth reaching out; the combination of a strong r sum  with a cover letter that demonstrates one's passion-and the ability to make that passion contagious-can turn heads and open doors.

Development associates also possess strong organizational, multitasking, and information-management skills, which help them keep a handle on the sensitive information that passes through their hands.
 Work Life
 Development associates usually work conventional business hours in an office setting. However, those who specialize in events may work more flexible schedules and late nights, and may travel for the job. There is also an expectation that development associates, no matter their role, try to attend events at other local nonprofits, both to support peers and as a form of research.

Digital Content Producer,52119,Music Business & Management,"digital content producer, marketing, promotion, advertisement, social media, online, computer","What does a Digital Content Producer do?
 Having a strong website is a necessity for any business or nonprofit organization, which is why web developers remain in such high demand. But developers are only half of the equation; it's digital content producers who furnish websites with articles, descriptions, bios, lists, photography, videos, sound clips, music, and more. Their goal: to create consistent, high-quality, topical content that keeps users coming back, encouraging them to choose this site over any of the internet ´s myriad other distractions.
 Digital content producers must be skilled writers and editors, with a strong grasp of grammar, style, and on-brand writing.
 As for many newly created positions in the field of digital marketing, there's no universal job description for digital content producers. Some content writers receive specific assignments, while others write to general guidelines or produce and publish articles, listicles, surveys, and more with few content guidelines. In addition to writing text, digital content producers might also work with images, videos, GIFs, music, and new media like livestreaming or VR. While some content producers create their own visual or auditory content, others simply curate, drawing from a wide range of sources and combining them in a way that feels current, engaging, and expressive. Additionally, like their cousins, social media managers, digital content producers are sometimes asked to create content for social media channels.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Digital content producers generally have at least an undergraduate degree. They are well served by a broad liberal arts education, but field of study doesn't matter nearly as much as demonstrating a high level of writing and editorial ability, and meshing well with the site's content goals. Most digital content producers start out as freelancers and work on a contractual basis, but may go on to join a writing or editorial team full-time. Experienced digital content producers might transition into related fields such as social media management, journalism, marketing, or interactive media design.
 Finding Work
 Digital content producers might be hired by any company with a site that requires a large amount or constant stream of newly created web-based content. This can include media companies like radio stations, television stations, newspapers, internet media sites, and blogging sites, as well as publishing companies, museums, record labels, music merchandisers, and even companies that create hardware or software products.
 Positions can generally be found on job listing websites like LinkedIn, Monster, and Glassdoor. If none can be found, don't underestimate the value of cold-emailing the team behind a content-driven website to inquire about openings-particularly if one sees a way the site's content could be improved.

They frequently work remotely and without much direct supervision, so time management skills and the ability to self direct are important. Being tapped into current events, the cultural zeitgeist, and the latest web-based communication techniques is a plus.
 Work Life
 Digital content producers either work as freelancers, in which case they likely work when and where they wish, or as members of a company's marketing or web team, in which case they may work set hours from an office.

Director (Theater and Opera),51120 or 51121,Directors and Supervisors,"director (theater and opera), leader, head, creative, vision","At the heart of almost any theatrical performance is the guiding hand of a director, a unique professional who takes charge of the production process and shapes almost every aspect of the show. Directors audition and cast actors; assemble and oversee the production team; provide design directives; lead rehearsals; and manage the production schedule of the project, ensuring that all the moving parts connect. Perhaps most importantly, they also supply a unifying understanding of the text and a particular vision for the production, which might mean a unique setting, a visual style or mood, or an interesting design concept that plays off themes in the text.
 
 It's the director's job to answer the difficult question of ""why"": why stage this show here, now, with these actors and for this audience? In essence, why does this performance matter?
 
 ? Directors typically begin their work on a production with careful reading and analysis of the script and its characters, sometimes aided by a dramaturg. Following this, the director assembles a creative team that might include a set designer, costume designer, sound designer, lighting designer, prop artist, choreographer, music director, and even the playwright or librettist. This creative team works closely with the director, altering and polishing the production's artistic vision and providing insight on design implentation. The work continues in rehearsals, where the director assisted by stage managers guides actors through the process of understanding their roles and lines, controls and refines the pacing of scenes, and implements blocking and choreography. Once the show opens, the director's job is complete and responsibility for future performances passes to the stage manager, although the director might still provide small performance notes.
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 This senior position is, for many, the culmination of a long career in theater working one's way up from stage and technical crews to become first a lead designer, stage manager, or production manager, then an assistant director, and then, finally, the director. Still, not everyone takes the same path; some break into directing early in their careers by producing their own work or founding a small theater company, while others find success as performers before trying their hand at direction. For directors, success means being hired by prestigious companies to direct high-budget productions, finding long-term positions or residencies at theater companies or universities, or rising to the top of a theater company as the artistic director.
 
 Finding Work
 Most directors are independent contractors who are hired by theater producers and companies on a per-project basis, although some have full-time positions or residencies with theater companies, or with university theater departments as professors or teaching artists. This is considered a tough field to break into, because aspiring directors can't learn the craft without doing it, and they can't get hired to do it until they've proven themselves capable. Aspiring directors should learn everything they can about theatrical direction, production, design, acting, and more and if initial opportunities aren't forthcoming, should create their own by producing and directing shows independently. Additionally, building a network of connections and a solid industry reputation is vital to landing jobs, which are often found via word of mouth.

It's the director's job to answer the difficult question of ""why"": why stage this show here, now, with these actors and for this audience? In essence, why does this performance matter?
 
 Work Life
 Like most theater artists, directors tend to work in bursts. Several months of intensive labor on a show culminate in the arduous final dash to the performance, followed by an abrupt transition to downtime, during which directors have the opportunity to relax, regroup, network, and acquire new skills before setting out on the next creative journey.

Director of Publicity,10022 or 52119,Music Business & Management,"director of publicity, social media, image, media, news, public appearance","What does a Director of Publicity do?
 An old adage says, ""There's no such thing as bad publicity."" While that claim is debatable, there's no doubt about the value of good publicity, which can make or break an album, concert tour, or other newsworthy event.
 Working to support an overall marketing strategy, directors of publicity pursue the (mostly) free advertising obtained from news stories, feature articles, reviews, interviews, and other mentions of a client, product, or brand in traditional, online, and social media.
 The publicity director oversees a staff of publicists who manage individual client accounts, closely monitoring progress and outcomes, identifying areas for improvement, and delivering reports to the label or company executives. For a star client, directors may take on the full range of a publicist's duties-from orchestrating a media blitz to writing news releases and working the phones.
 However, at the end of the day it's the director who is held responsible for the success or failure of a company's publicity efforts, and it's the director who takes the lead on crafting a media campaign's overarching message, theme, or narrative: the loss that led to an artist's transcendent comeback album, for example, or a young star's transition from television actor to pop singer.
 In addition, publicity directors select the media outlets and influencers that will help reach the artist or album's target audience. When a client receives negative press, publicity directors use years of experience in the field to assist publicists in the delicate process of counteracting harmful narratives.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Publicity directors work for record label publicity departments, public relations firms, and entertainment companies. Typically, the career path begins with a junior publicist, assistant publicist, or internship position, followed by work as a publicist and, eventually, promotion to the assistant director or director of publicity. Some directors go on to open their own PR firms.
 Finding Work
 Publicity directors usually work as publicists before being promoted within the company or seeking a directing position at a smaller company. Experience working as a tour publicist or music journalist can also be highly valuable for this job.

 Work Life
 In addition to long days in an office overseeing staff, crafting campaigns, filing reports, and putting out media fires, publicity directors can expect to spend plenty of time after-hours making contacts and nurturing connections at concerts, shows, events, and parties. Like publicists, directors of publicity work in a 24-hour news cycle, meaning that they must stay engaged with their work even when on vacation.

DJ (Studio or Performing),55109 or 51122,Musicians and Singers,"dj (studio or performing), musician, remix, individual, unique, crowd, style, computer, digital, ","? Originally, DJs were hybrid curator-performers who would select and play sets of the dayÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ­s hottest records on turntables the eponymous Ã¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¬discsÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ® and use complex analog techniques to tweak the music as it played. DJs still do all of this today although the analog techniques have largely been replaced with digital software. While some DJs focus almost exclusively on setlist-building and nightclub performance and others are more production-oriented, most do a combination of both. 
 
 The traditional live DJ setup includes a mixer, two turntables, a sound system, and headphones, but a plethora of digital tools are now available to supplement this. Performing DJs may mix music on the fly, or use looping, effects, and other techniques to change the sound or structure of a track. Often, they create a seamless and thrilling flow by manipulating intros and outros, matching tempos, keys, and audio levels, and generally smoothing out transitions. DJs today fill many roles, including performer, manager, accountant, promoter, and social media coordinator.
 
 There are several opportunities for specialization as a DJ:
 
 Club and Festival DJ: A producer/DJ focused on playing long two- to three-hour sets featuring genre-specific selections. These DJs often create original music and remixes and integrate live remixing and production elements as well as augment their shows with custom/creative video content and lighting, in addition to running sound for performers. They push the limits to create engaging performances for fans drawn to their particular style of music or originality in mixing. Livestreaming DJing has more recently increased in popularity, offering audiences a live experience from their homes.
 Mobile DJ: These DJs perform at events such as weddings, parties, and other celebrations, and are focused on playing long gigs that last the whole night or the duration of the event featuring crossover (mainstream and pop) selections. Fans appreciate their ability to curate a mix of popular music from different genres. Like the club and festival DJ, mobile DJs can run sound for performers. 
 Turntablist: Focused on playing short routines (six minutes) for competitions, turntablists use the latest gear and performance techniques such as beat mixing/matching, scratching, and beat juggling, often in concert-style settings. They can manipulate their equipment to function as a musical instrument and create new music from existing sounds for live remixing. They may even be members of a band. Their audience is impressed with their technical ability and creativity. 
 Radio/Podcast DJ: These DJs work in a prerecorded mix format, with podcasts being a natural extension for this specialization. They create a mix for listeners, blending the audienceÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ­s favorite styles while introducing them to new music. DJ podcasts provide an opportunity to reach a wider audience and engage with fans, as well as promote music and events.

 DJs need drive, skill, and great musical sense. Training in electronic performance, live DJs might start out working friendsÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ­ parties and events before progressing to independent DJ sets at local nightclubs or touring as the opener for a similar musical act. 
 
 Club and festival DJs often require a team of people to get their career to take off, including a manager, booking agent, tour manager, video technician, and lighting technician. For mobile DJs, some specialized skills are beneficial: the ability to create a full production from sound system and lighting setup to event flow and load-in/load-out. ItÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ­s advantageous for mobile DJs to own their own equipment. Mobile DJs and turntablists should be skilled in the latest technological advances in gear and performance techniques. Podcast DJs should be familiar with DJ software programs and podcast production. Formal training in electronic performance would provide aspiring DJs with the skills and knowledge necessary to be successful in this career. 
 
 Finding Work
 DJs are hired for one-off or weekly shows by nightclub bookers, talent buyers, and event planners. They also frequently play festivals.
 
 Live DJs who are just starting out often cut their teeth and test-drive their skills in the public space, with the goal of developing a following and then advancing to bigger rooms and a larger paycheck while building relationships and their networks. Just like with a band, DJs start small and grow as they build a fanbase and audience. Some find regular work with event organizers who provide DJs for weddings, bar/bat mitzvahs, and corporate or other special events.

Drama Teacher,53121 or 51122,Music Education,"drama teacher, teacher, drama, theatre, acting, instructor, education","What does a Drama Teacher do?
 Drama teachers teach courses related to theater and helm student-assisted productions of plays, musicals, and more. While almost all drama teachers teach acting, that doesn't mean they're acting teachers; drama teachers also teach courses in numerous other theatrical subjects including history of theater, stage management, and directing. Drama teachers work with students from across the spectrum of age groups and experience levels, with aims that-correspondingly-range from merely developing a student's confidence and interest in theater to producing a professional-level theater artist with broad training and experience.
 Most drama teachers are experienced theater professionals-veteran actors, directors, dramaturgs, playwrights, and technical theater artists.
 Lower-level theater courses might focus on theater as play, incorporating improv and theater games and exposing students to a range of theatrical experiences, from acting to playwriting. On the other hand, upper-level theater education courses tend to be highly specialized, splitting into broad subjects like acting, directing, theater history, technical theater, and playwriting. At the conservatory or coaching level, a single subject like acting might be broken into numerous courses and approaches, including speech and voice, movement, repertoire, character research, auditioning, or even holistic acting techniques such as American method, Meisner technique, or Stanislavski's system. Regardless of their specialization or the level at which they teach, almost all drama teachers are involved in leading students in staging theatrical productions-for when it comes to the performing arts, there is truly no better teacher than experience.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Whether they set their theater career aside or continue it alongside teaching as teaching artists, most drama teachers are experienced theater professionals-veteran actors, directors, dramaturgs, playwrights, and technical theater artists. While almost all drama teachers possess bachelor's degrees, usually only those who work at the college, university, or conservatory level are required to have master's degrees. Successful drama teachers can go on to become the director of the school's drama program, or enter the more lucrative field of high-level acting coaching, specializing in fields such as voice and accent coaching or movement coaching. Those who deeply appreciate the way theater changes and improves lives might be suited to careers as a nonprofit artist or drama therapist.
 Finding Work
 Drama teachers typically work for primary schools, secondary schools, high schools, colleges and universities, conservatories, and private acting schools. Those with a special license may work for nurseries, day cares, preschools, or kindergartens as early childhood arts educators. Nonprofit artists might teach in nontraditional settings like hospitals, prisons, community centers, homeless shelters, and foreign countries. Experienced actors and teachers might also work for television and film companies as professional coaches-or be self-employed.

Additionally, teachers should be familiar with a wide variety of literature and possess the analytical skills to dissect scripts and provide notes to students.
 Work Life
 Schoolteachers tend to have consistent daily schedules that may include after-school assignments, leading student clubs, and rehearsing for productions. Private acting teachers and on-set coaches have more unpredictable work schedules, including last-minute sessions with students facing an impending audition, or directors in need of assistance while already in production.

Dramaturg,51120,"Acting, Theatre & Dance","dramaturg, editor, research, interpreter, geography, reading, learning, play, theatre, collaborate, collaboration","What does a Dramaturg do?
 Dramaturgs are experts in the study of plays, musicals, or operas. It is their job to provide the cast and crew with vital knowledge, research, and interpretation about the theatrical work in question so that they are-in turn-better equipped to do their jobs. Sometimes the information dramaturgs provide concerns the temporal, geographic, or cultural setting of a production, while other times it's about the playwright or librettist's life, or personal and political events that may have influenced the work.
 Dramaturgy is a flexible career that often means a mix of office-based work, independent research and reading, participation in rehearsals and post-performance talkbacks, and time spent off the job discussing plays and networking with other like-minded dramaturgs.
 Regardless of the specifics, it's the dramaturg's job to bring context to bear on the production, imparting clarity for directors seeking to understand a play's subtext, actors trying to understand the world and intentions of their characters, and designers attempting to incorporate historical elements into the show's costumes, sets, props, or sounds. It ´s the dramaturg's job to know as much as possible about the play at hand, including its themes, language, period, history, music, and even past stagings, and to hold the current production to a high standard of historical and textual accuracy.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Theaters typically look for candidates with at least a bachelor's degree in theater or literature, often preferring those with a master's degree. Because the position is a scholarly one that entails research into a variety of topics, including history, sociology, art, and linguistics, dramaturgs are well served by a broad course of study with a base in the liberal arts. Beginning dramaturgs may get their first credits working on college-level or community productions, or work their way up a theater company's literary department-starting with a literary apprenticeship-before taking on freelance dramaturgy work. Although this is not always the case, dramaturgs are often also playwrights themselves.
 Finding Work
 While dramaturgs working on productions are often hired on a freelance, per-project basis, dramaturgs frequently work full-time for large theater and opera companies as literary associates, hosting post-show talkbacks and conversations as well as providing program notes for the company's productions. Literary departments often have apprenticeship programs in lieu of-or in addition to-entry-level positions.

 Interpersonal Skills
 Working as a dramaturg requires immense research abilities, along with the analytical abilities to dig deep into a play's text and the communication skills to communicate all this information to actors, directors, and designers who lack the same literary basis. Dramaturgs are usually people who love reading, learning, and sharing knowledge with others. At the same time, they're a vital part of the production team, and must have excellent collaborative abilities: knowing when in the creative process to pipe up with feedback and when to hang back and let the director and actors work.
 Work Life
 Dramaturgs spend the vast majority of their working hours performing research by themselves. Their moment to shine, however, is the fairly small portion of their time that they spend conveying their research to the cast and crew in rehearsal. All in all, dramaturgy is a flexible career that often means a mix of office-based work, independent research and reading, participation in rehearsals and post-performance talkbacks, and time spent off the job discussing plays and networking with other like-minded dramaturgs.

Early Childhood Arts Educator,51122,Music Education,"early childhood arts educator, instructor, children, teacher, artistic, creative, psychology","What does an Early Childhood Arts Educator do?
 Creative arts-based play is widely understood to be an important part of childhood growth and development. Early childhood arts educators play a crucial role in introducing young children to the joys of music, dance, and theater, as well as the many positive emotional, intellectual, and social benefits that accompany an arts education. Early childhood educators might specialize in a single art form or expose children to aspects of many different ones.
 Working with children requires patience, enthusiasm, warmth, excellent listening skills, respect for diversity, and a deep love of young people.
 In order to bring young children into the world of dance, early childhood educators use time-honored activities such as improvising movement; investigating shapes and space; responding to rhythms; moving with props; and exploring concepts such as partnering, mirroring, and follow-the-leader. When it comes to theater exploration, educators might lead children in pantomiming daily activities, acting out stories, using puppets and masks to create characters, or giving classroom objects imaginary qualities. There are countless ways teachers can bring music into the classroom: singing loudly and softly, high and low, and fast and slow to explore dynamics; clapping in different rhythmic patterns; using found objects to create sounds; and listening to a variety of music.
 Some educators are trained to offer a more formal music education to young children based on established approaches such as Suzuki Early Childhood Education. Depending on the setting and the teacher's responsibilities (i.e., whether they are an arts specialist or a general teacher), they may engage in a variety of activities with children and supervise them during meal time, nap time, and personal hygiene activities.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Thanks to continued research into the importance and many benefits of arts education for children, early childhood arts education is a fast-growing field. Early childhood arts educators must fulfill the relevant education, training, and certification requirements of their state or country in order to work. Early childhood educators with a passion for working with differently abled children might become adaptive arts teachers. Others might transition into teaching higher grades, become a private instructor, or advance to be the program director of their department or educational institution.
 Finding Work
 Early childhood educators work for preschools, public schools, private schools, Head Start programs, and day-care centers, as well as religious organizations like churches, synagogues, YMCAs, and Jewish community centers. Aspiring arts educators can get experience working as a volunteer, intern, teacher's aide, or substitute teacher-all of which help build r sum s.

Electronic Musician,51122,Musicians and Singers,"electronic musician, musician, studio, synthesizer, MIDI, producer, programmer, computer, digital,","? While there is a long history of musicians utilizing electronic instruments to enhance and define their sound, artists who employ electronic instruments to compose, produce music, or manipulate their voice through various technology tools and platforms are considered electronic musicians. Electronic musicians create music from either electronically generated or electronically modified sounds in one of two ways: by using electronic devices or by modifying natural sounds. They often utilize many tools at once, pulling from both the analog and digital arena. 
 
 From modular synthesizers to loop stations to effects pedals to laptop computers to performance controllers, instruments vary and can be combined for a layered effect. More specifically, an electronic digital instrument (EDI) is composed of three components a computer with music software and a performance controller.
 
 Electronic musicians compose in the studio as well as operate as part of a band or as a one-person show when performing live, or creating and mixing sound in real time.

Ensemble Member (Musical Theater and Opera),51122,Musicians and Singers,"ensemble member (musical theater and opera), musician, player, band member, ensemble, section","? Since the earliest days of theater as an art form, ensemble members have helped to immerse the audience in the world of the show, creating the platform for the story to unfold. Their role, however, has changed through the ages: from the Greek chorus to the professional dancers of early Broadway, all the way to today's ensemble members, consummate performers often described as ""triple threats"" for their impressive singing, acting, and dancing abilities. Unlike a principal actor, a contemporary ensemble member might play a different character in every scene, rapidly switching between costumes and identities to embody the unnamed world of the play. For this reason, an ensemble member's part in the show is often referred to as his or her ""track,"" a term which encompasses all the characters, lines, blocking, dance choreography, prop placements, and backstage traffic that the ensemblist must memorize and execute.
 
 There are multiple special positions of note within theatrical ensembles, including dance captains, understudies, and swings. Dance captains are the keepers of the show's choreography; they bring replacement actors up to speed, lead routine dance rehearsals after the show opens, and document the show's blocking and choreography in a book known as the ""show bible."" Understudies are well known even outside of the theater industry: in addition to their ensemble track, they learn one of the principal roles so as to be prepared to fill in at a moment's notice. Much less well known is the swing, a dedicated understudy for the show's entire ensemble. Unlike dance captains and understudies, swings do not have roles of their own; instead, they learn every male or female ensemble track and take over for whoever's missing that night. It's a challenging position reserved for versatile performers with excellent memory and the ability to compartmentalize.
 
 Dance is a primary skill for most ensemblists, who typically begin by learning ballet as a base before progressing into other styles including jazz, hip hop, modern, tap, and ballroom. Musical theater choreography, which has become a style all its own, must also be learned, starting with old movie musicals and recordings of classic performances. To cultivate their singing talents, ensemble performers take voice lessons, develop their own warm-up routines, and prepare a diverse selection of material to showcase their range in auditions. Particularly important qualities are vocal confidence and the ability to express character through one's singing and dancing.
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Ensemble members come from a wide range of backgrounds but what almost all have in common is a love of theater from an early age. Although some may primarily identify as dancers and others as singers or actors, only those with a multidisciplinarian skill set are eligible for the most common Broadway ensemble jobs. While non-singing ensemble parts exist, they are rare, as producers tend to prefer the increased understudying flexibility provided by an ensemble member who can sing. Ensemble members might go on to become successful principal actors in the musical and opera worlds, find work as backup dancers for touring artists, or transition into non-performing careers like choreographer, drama teacher, dance teacher, or movement coach.
 
 Finding Work
 Finding work as an ensemble member is all about mastering the art of the audition, wherein ensemblists must demonstrate their abilities to quickly learn and beautifully execute choreography, to sing and harmonize effectively across a range of genres, to embody different characters with their voice and movement, and to take direction. Ensemble members who can do all of that won't struggle to find work.
 
 While building audition skills, there are a number of things aspiring ensemble members can do to improve their chances of getting gigs paying close attention to audition postings across a wide range of platforms, for one. Additionally, one might create a portfolio or website with videos to showcase one's work, build a detailed theatrical resum , and get headshots and full-body photographs taken. As anywhere in the theater industry, networking is absolutely vital; some Broadway ensemblists even recommend finding a dance teacher who works as a Broadway choreographer in order to make an additional connection.

Additionally, ensemble members should strive to be exceptional collaborators, humble and good at taking direction from music directors and dance captains, with whom they work closely.
 
 Work Life
 Ensemble members work an intense schedule, including daily rehearsals from afternoon to evening while the show is in production, and up to 8 shows per week once it's running. The two two-show days each week are particularly exhausting, while Monday is the hallowed day off when most theaters go dark. Outside of work, ensemble dancers must work out to stay in excellent shape, take classes to learn new techniques and improve the old, and monitor their health and diet. There's also the option to go on the road with a touring production. While the schedule is exhausting, as a steady and secure gig in the largely freelance field of theater, being an ensemble member on a Broadway production can't be beat.

Event Operations Coordinator,52119,Music Business & Management,"event operations coordinator, logistics, planning, coordinator, organization","What does an Event Operations Coordinator do?
 Bringing together large numbers of people for a concert, convention, theatrical performance, fundraiser, or festival can be incredibly rewarding, but doing it right requires excellent research, planning, and coordination. Event operations coordinators take responsibility for every aspect of the events they manage, and ensure that people are talking about them for all the right reasons instead of the wrong ones-such as a poorly equipped venue, inadequate crowd control, or a dangerous incident.
 Good event operations employees have an uncanny ability to look into the future of a situation, see what could possibly go wrong, and plan for it.
 When it comes to planning and executing a live event, event operations coordinators do it all: they scout locations and bring in missing equipment; contract with vendors for food, bathrooms, and other necessities; hire all event staff, including security; create and post necessary signage; work through logistics concerning the site and weather; and oversee cleanup afterwards. If licenses are needed, or if contracts contain curfew stipulations, event operations coordinators seek and maintain those orders-and when problems of any kind occur, it's their job to be on-site, managing the situation. Although their main responsibility is the logistics of events, in rare cases operations coordinators will take on some of the duties of concert/event producers, including booking talent and transportation and overseeing the rental and maintenance of audio and video equipment.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Most event coordinators get their start in the field by organizing and staffing local and university events or volunteering for music festivals or conventions. This kind of early experience is the perfect qualification for entry-level positions in the operations staff, from where one can gain experience and progress to become a full-fledged coordinator. Event operations coordinators are usually qualified for jobs on the basis of their experience and track record rather than education, but a degree in hospitality or event management can speed things up.
 Event coordinators whose events consistently go off with a hitch can build a strong reputation in the industry or work their way up a company ladder, becoming senior events associates or operations directors. Some go on to become concert/event producers, who have a more involved role in the artistic and technical planning of the performance. Others leave the concert/live event scene and apply the skills they've gained to other industries and organizations, becoming operations directors for theater companies, educational institutes, or museums.
 Finding Work
 Event operations coordinators usually work for independent event-planning companies, which may take on a variety of events as jobs or specialize in a particular variety, such as weddings, festivals, tours, or conventions. Event operations coordinators may also work in-house for companies that own and rent large event spaces, like fairgrounds, ballrooms, and event halls. Some event coordinators are fully freelance, but due to the high labor requirement in organizing live events it's much more common to pool resources in a company, however small.

They are also excellent multitaskers who are deeply concerned with efficiency and resource management.
 Work Life
 For events operations coordinators, life can be unpredictable. Their schedules vary widely depending on whether a large-scale event is coming up or already under way. Event coordinators are always on hand at the events they plan, troubleshooting issues as they arise. They are the first to arrive and the last to leave, setting up and staying late to ensure cleanup is completed, vendors are paid, and audience members are happy. Between events, they usually have more breathing room, and may only have minor administrative tasks to take care of until it's time to start on the next event. The job can require some travel, particularly for the best in the business, who are always in high demand.

Expressive Arts Therapist,41301,Health & Wellness,"expressive arts therapist, therapy, psychology, patient","? Self-expression is a basic human behavior, a way of putting the self in relation to the rest of the world. It consists of creating or arranging something external words, sounds, colors, movements, objects in order to express something internal and often personal. Few understand the power and importance of this kind of artistic creation better than expressive arts therapists, who use the same process to help clients make sense of their lives, process difficult memories or experiences, reduce daily stress, increase resilience, address specific behavioral and psychological problems, and even cope with the distress caused by medical illnesses. Unlike music therapists, drama therapists, or dance/movement therapists, expressive arts therapists use a multimodal method, meaning they employ many different expressive forms in treatment. As a result, they have a great ability to tailor their approach to the specific needs, capabilities, and responses of the client.
 
 Expressive arts therapists are chiefly interested in using the creative process to trigger healing and growth.
 
 Rather than educating clients on art-making techniques or critiquing their work, expressive arts therapists are chiefly interested in using the creative process to trigger healing and growth. Results are derived both from the inherent therapeutic value of self-expression an outlet that can bring feelings of relief, calm, agency, and accomplishment and the process of discussing and unpacking the emotions, ideas, and memories that inevitably surface when people enter an engaged creative state. To that end, most therapists use classical art forms like music, drama, dance, painting, writing, and sculpture. However, there are also many less obvious but no less effective avenues of expression, such as photography, fashion, decorating, cooking, gardening, game-making, mask-making, and imaginative play. Clients may include children, adults, and families in individual or group sessions.
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Expressive arts therapists come from many artistic backgrounds, but are generally united by an interest in health and wellness and using the arts to inspire and empower others. Some begin as therapists working with only a single creative art for example, a music therapist, dance therapist, or drama therapist before later incorporating other artistic modes into their practice, and seeking certification as an official expressive arts therapist. Education is relatively important in this field; most expressive arts therapists will need a master's degree. Seasoned therapists might start their own clinic, found an art-therapy nonprofit, switch to teaching, or get a doctoral degree and begin conducting research.
 
 Finding Work
 Any mental health professional can use the expressive arts in their therapeutic process, but only those qualified by the International Expressive Arts Therapy Association (IEATA) can practice as registered expressive arts therapists. To be certified, one needs at minimum a master's degree in counseling or a related field and to complete an affiliated training program including supervised clinical work. Most expressive arts therapists are freelancers and can find work in a wide variety of settings, including private practices, medical and mental hospitals, hospice, community centers, rehabilitation programs, and correctional facilities.

Festival Director,51120,Directors and Supervisors,"festival director, leader, organizer, event, ","What does a Festival Director do?
 Festivals come in all shapes and sizes, and the job of directing a small chamber music festival is quite different from the job of directing, say, Lollapalooza. Still, all festival organizers have the same overarching goal: to run a successful and well-attended festival that comes off without a hitch. It might be a simple-sounding mission statement, but is certainly no simple task. Festival directors oversee almost every logistical facet of the festival, which means juggling dozens of operations at once.
 Festival directors must be able to multitask, delegate, meet tight deadlines, and problem-solve on the fly without losing their cool.
 The festival director is usually responsible for securing the necessary permits and insurance for the event; building relationships with local contractors and companies that provide goods and services; staffing the festival; creating materials such as maps and signage; planning and supervising site setup and breakdown; overseeing a team of event operations coordinators; and directing user experiences such as festival-centric mobile apps. They might also work closely with talent buyers and concert producers to book and coordinate with artists and their teams. And all of that before the gates even open!
 During the festival, the director is in constant motion, making sure that everyone has what they need, that all of the parts are moving smoothly, and that everything is proceeding according to plan. Needless to say, there are many opportunities for things to go wrong, from a delayed ice delivery to a last-minute performer cancellation. It's the festival director's job-with the help of a skilled staff-to plug holes and devise fixes on the fly without affecting the audience, creating a seamless experience.

 Festival directors are incredibly detail-oriented and possess excellent communication skills. They must be able to multitask, delegate, meet tight deadlines, and problem-solve on the fly without losing their cool. A good festival director is simultaneously perfectionistic in their pursuit of the best possible festival experience and utterly prepared when things don't go as planned. It's also important to have a strong vision both for audience experience and staff operation.
 Work Life
 During the early period of conceiving of and planning the event, festival directors spend an impressive amount of time on email and the phone, creating and negotiating the connections, relationships, and teams that will form the basis of the event. During the run-up to the festival, they are likely to work long days and nights to ensure that everything is progressing according to schedule. During the festival, directors are likely to actively manage personnel and delegate problem-solving as necessary. It's only after the last scraps of garbage have been swept up that the festival director can finally relax and begin to catch up on sleep until the process repeats itself in a few weeks.

Field Merchandiser,52119,Music Business & Management,"field merchandiser, marketing, promotion, merchandise, front of house, products","What does a Field Merchandiser do?
 A hybrid sales and marketing position, field merchandisers are employed by record labels to ensure that the practical execution of marketing and promotional plans goes smoothly. While record label marketers plan out contests, giveaways, and other broad promotional strategies and commission materials such as posters, buttons, bumper stickers, and T-shirts, it ´s the job of the field merchandiser to travel to store and venue locations, distribute the free marketing materials, collect sales data from independent vendors, and monitor the implementation of marketing strategies.
 Sales experience, especially at a large record store, is invaluable to finding a position as a field merchandiser.
 Field merchandisers travel from store to store, advising shop owners and managers on setup or display of merchandise and explaining the rules for current promotions such as giveaways and contests. If their record label has scheduled in-store appearances for artists, field merchandisers may be responsible for bringing in flyers, posters, and CDs for signing and promoting the appearance.
 Field merchandisers may also attend both marketing and sales staff meetings, where they share their valuable perspective on how new promotions are being received by stores and customers, how certain goods are selling compared with others, and how all aspects of point-of-sale promotion could be improved. Field merchandisers who consistently bring helpful insights to the table are strong candidates for promotion.

 Career Path
 This is a part or full-time entry-level position that may require a small amount of experience in music retail, merchandising, marketing, or promotion. This position is one of several possible next steps for college marketing representatives. Field merchandisers are functionally members of the record label marketing department and can climb the department ladder to become marketing representatives and eventually marketing managers. They may also use their experience with merchandising and retail to join a record label sales department or a music merchandising company.
 Due to the influence of online shopping and music streaming on physical retail sales and record store culture, the responsibilities of a field merchandiser are changing rapidly.
 Finding Work
 Sales experience, especially at a large record store, is very helpful for securing a position as a field merchandiser. Interning at a record label or working as a college marketing representative increase one's chances of finding a position.

 Interpersonal Skills
 Written and verbal communication are critical for field merchandisers, who not only need to clearly convey complex promotion and display instructions to store managers, but also to listen closely to the feedback of store managers and customers, and convey some of these thoughts and concerns to the rest of the marketing team.
 Field merchandisers excel at making strong professional connections based on communication and reciprocity-and hopefully a shared love for music as well. They are observant and independent problem-solvers, keeping an eye out for anything that might become a problem down the road and taking care of it beforehand.
 Work Life
 Field merchandisers may work part- or full-time. Since their day-to-day work is largely independent their working hours may vary, although they generally fall within the open hours of the accounts (mainly record stores and music venues) with whom the field merchandiser works. Field merchandisers spend a large amount of time on the job traveling between accounts within their regional area, and so must be capable drivers who are comfortable with an occasional stay at a motel.

Freelance Composer,51121,"Composition, Scoring, and Songwriting","freelance composer, independant, opportunist, versatile, application","What does a Freelance Composer do?
 When we think about audiences experiencing and connecting with music, we tend to picture it happening in spaces like concert halls and clubs. However, the truth is that our society is filled to the brim with music, and not always in the places you'd expect; businesses, nonprofits, event organizers, and more all use original music to inspire their employees, sell their products, create immersive spaces, and cultivate a consistent sonic brand. The bulk of this music is written by freelance composers, who employ a flexible tool kit-including both music composition and production skills-to succeed in a challenging market.
 Most freelance composers work out of home studios, where they write, record, mix, and edit custom-composed music for their clients.
 Freelance composers write music for an exceptionally wide variety of clients and purposes. Some companies commission corporate theme music for use in rallies and advertisement, while others that host or participate in conventions, trade shows, and other live events commission background and theme music. Businesses like interactive-hardware manufacturers use custom-composed music in a completely different way, integrating it directly into products like children's toys, arcade games, theme park attractions, and gambling machines. Similarly, software developers use short snippets of custom-composed music as startup jingles. Finally, there are clients in nonprofits and the arts, like museums, art galleries, and directors of theatrical performances.
 However, the most lucrative source of business for a freelance composer is something else entirely: synchronization (or ""sync"") placements, where a composer's music is synchronized to a film, TV show, video game, or advertisement. These deals are most frequently brokered by music libraries, intermediary companies that were formed for exactly this purpose. Music libraries are a huge source of work for freelance composers; in addition to passing on commissions to their go-to contributors, they also purchase partial ownership of, or lease compositions directly from, freelance composers to fill their own catalogs. For freelance composers, the benefit of getting music in a library is twofold: an initial payment for the rights along with the possibility of later income from placements. Although the days of ""staff writing"" are for the most part over-arrangements wherein libraries would contract and pay an advance to particularly good composers in exchange for exclusivity-music libraries are still a vitally important part of the freelance music ecosystem.

 Career Path
 Although there are no specific educational requirements for working as a freelance composer, most are highly trained with a focus on contemporary composition and production. The first few years as a freelance composer can be challenging, as one is unlikely to have the contacts, reputation, and industry-specific knowledge to find consistent work. However, this is the kind of career that snowballs, and a mid-career freelance composer is likely to have a well-established network of clients and an industry reputation that makes finding work manageable, if not easy.
 Throughout their careers, freelance composers might flit in and out of more long-term positions, such as at an advertising agency or music production house. Successful freelance composers might switch over entirely to permanent in-house positions at music-centric companies, shift into writing music for television and movies, or move into marketing-centric roles that focus on the power of sonic branding. Or they might keep working as freelance composers as long as they can.
 Finding Work
 Breaking into the profession initially is one of the hardest parts of working as a freelance composer. In order to create a steady flow of work, aspiring freelance composers should try to:
 Send portfolios to intermediary organizations like music libraries and publishers
 Advertise and self-promote through a professional website with a partial musical portfolio
 Network and share knowledge with established freelance composers
 Reach out to local businesses and nonprofits
 When making a new deal with a music library or publisher, freelance composers should consider consulting with a music attorney in order to fully understand how the arrangement will affect ownership of their music.

 The one thing all freelance composers have in spades is ""hustle,"" the entrepreneurial, forward-looking spirit that enables them to find new opportunities and relish, rather than regret, the uncertainty of their career. Musical flexibility is another must for freelance composers, who might go from making a corporate pump-up track with French horns one minute to collaborating with a songwriter on a track with a cinematic feel the next.
 Great communication skills only help, as freelance composers must suss out exactly what kind of music clients need, even when clients may not understand or be able to communicate this themselves. For composers who are more interested in writing for music libraries than specific clients, paying close attention to musical trends and popular genres is vital; it's about predicting the kind of sound people want. Finally, self-motivation and a good work routine are key: freelance composers don't have the luxury of waiting for inspiration to strike.
 Work Life
 Most freelance composers work out of home studios, where they write, record, mix, and edit custom-composed music for their clients. They set their own hours, and may combine this career with another, such as teaching composition at a school or conservatory.

General Business Musician (Freelance Musician),51122,Musicians and Singers,"general business musician (freelance musician), independent, on-call, request, events","? General business musicians are professional musicians who specialize in performing ""general business"" gigs: private events such as conferences, weddings, religious events, birthday parties, dances, and corporate functions. To do so, they must cultivate a wide repertoire of recognizable popular music in a variety of musical genres, and alter their style and playlist to suit their audience. This could mean playing peppy oldies for a middle-aged wedding reception one night and mellow jazz for a lounge setting the next.
 
 General business musicians must understand that they arenÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ­t the stars of the show their job is to support the event and make sure everyone has a good time, not to push their own art. 
 
 Some general business musicians are solo performers, but more commonly they perform with a band, often called a floor or show band. They might also play with a cover band. While performing is their primary job, being a freelance musician also means being and running a business. Marketing the band, booking gigs, meeting with clients to discuss needs, updating social media, and networking to develop a consistent client base all come with the territory. General business musicians who lead their own show bands must also select playlists, craft arrangements, and schedule and lead rehearsals.
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Alongside session and touring work, general business gigs represent a major porition of the freelance work available for professional musicians who haven't broken through as recording artists. While some make playing general business gigs their career and life's work, for most it's simply another way to make a living while pursuing another angle, like auditioning for orchestras, playing with an original band, or writing songs.
 
 General business musicians can secure more consistent work by partnering with event planning companies and more lucrative work by developing a reputation in higher-class and corporate circles. Some general business musicians use their knowledge of the field to start their own booking or event planning agencies.
 
 Finding Work
 While many find their first general business gigs by doing favors for friends who need a band to play their nephew's bar mitzvah or their company's holiday mixer, this isn't a sustainable model for finding work. If one is interested in a long-term career in this field, finding a booking agency or events planning company to partner with is the first step but be advised that they may take a cut. It's also beneficial to seek out professional partnerships with wedding planners and party planners, as well as recurring gigs at restaurants, clubs, and bars.

General Manager (Orchestra),52119,Music Business & Management,"general manager (orchestra), finances, resources, organization, management, planning, touring","What does a General Manager (Orchestra) do?
 The general manager is a logistics expert whose responsibilities span every facet of an orchestra's activities, from administration and scheduling to production and personnel. In some organizations, the general manager personally carries out the many tasks involved in the daily operations of an orchestra; in others, the general manager delegates part of the work to their staff, including an operations manager and a personnel manager.
 Arts Administration
 Working with the orchestra's executive director and music director, the general manager develops and implements the orchestra's master schedule, a multidepartmental roadmap for achieving the orchestra's goals. With this vision in mind, the general manager undertakes a number of arts-administration-oriented duties, including:
 engaging guest artists and conductors;
 taking part in fee and contract negotiations;
 building rehearsal and performance schedules;
 commissioning new works for the orchestra; and
 organizing the orchestra's electronic media.
 Other Duties
 Depending on the orchestra in question, the general manager may also:
 book and manage relationships with venues;
 secure clearances for music rights;
 oversee marketing and fundraising initiatives;
 act as the primary liaison between departments, ensuring that information is communicated accurately and efficiently throughout the organization;
 manage the orchestra's library, as well as education and volunteer activities;
 supervise auditions; and
 prepare the venue for performances.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 The general manager is the most senior position in the administrative branch of most orchestras, and answers to the executive director or board of the orchestra. Many general managers start out in entry-level orchestra positions, such as assistant personnel manager, before advancing to become personnel or operations manager, and from there landing a job as general manager. Some general managers transition from careers as performers but need to possess or acquire administrative experience in order to tackle the work of a manager.

 Academic Affairs
 Academic administrators are responsible for overseeing aspects of teaching and learning on campus. They hire and evaluate faculty; guide the development of majors, minors, and other programming; secure resources to support instruction; and facilitate some visiting artists and academic campus events. They also seek to engage professionals outside of the university, creating and maintaining networks that yield opportunities for students before and after graduation.
 
 Student Affairs
 Offices of student affairs are responsible for almost every aspect of a student's college or university experience outside of the classroom. These administrators ensure that students are properly housed, support students' access to physical and mental health resources, and provide career and academic counseling services. They also typically oversee student orientation, on- and off-campus events programming, and student clubs and organizations.
 
 Other Administrative Offices
 In addition to the above-mentioned offices, which attempt to directly affect the educational experiences of students, there are a number of administrative staff departments that contribute to the life of a higher education institution. These include admissions, alumni relations, institutional advancement, business, financial aid, human resources, communications, and more.
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 There's far more than a single path to becoming a higher education administrator. Some begin their careers while still undergraduates or immediately after graduating by interning or doing student work with administrative departments at their own institution. Others pursue their own artistic goals, become well-respected in their fields, work in areas such as community organization, event or concert production, or teaching, and then use their diverse skills and experiences to transition into higher education administration.
 
 As administrators move up the ladder, their level of responsibility grows exponentially. Senior academic administrators, in particular, are entrusted with broadly shaping the institution's educational approach simultaneously its main product and its identity. As a result, the requirements for senior positions are stringent, often including at least ten years of career experience, a master's degree at minimum, and more often than not a doctorate as well.
 
 Finding Work
 Undergraduate students with an interest in academic administration should start building their resumes early by seeking out internships and opportunities at their own institution. Recent graduates are advised to look for work in education or a related field first, or to begin working on their master's degree. For mid-career professionals, LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, and similar websites are excellent resources for finding jobs in higher education.

 Work Life
 A higher education administrator might work a regular nine-to-five schedule and spend almost every day in the office, or have an irregular itinerary complicated by travel, performance, or teaching. For most, a large portion of each day is spent participating in (and sometimes leading) intra- and interdepartmental meetings.

Independent Radio Promoter,52119,Music Business & Management,"independent radio promoter, independent artists, promotion, radio station, on-air, connection","What does an Independent Radio Promoter do?
 In the internet age, musicians can accomplish on their own many tasks for which they once relied on record labels. They can release their music through web-based platforms such as SoundCloud and Bandcamp, and use social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter for marketing. But one thing continues to be almost impossible for the average musician: finding radio airplay for their songs. That ´s where independent radio promoters come in. Acting as middlemen, radio promoters are hired by artists and labels to market new songs to program directors, music directors, and DJs. To do so, they rely on a network of professional connections at radio stations across the country and highly specialized knowledge of the field, ranging from which stations play what sort of music to each station ´s preferred way of receiving submissions.
 Radio promoters are excellent listeners, capable of hearing a record and breaking down its musical appeal to understand which radio stations are most likely to put it into rotation and which markets will benefit it the most.
 Most radio promoters have a specialty, which could be a radio type such as college radio, a specific format such as adult contemporary, or a region of the country. Although revenue from terrestrial radio has decreased in the 21st century, the continued power of radio to introduce music to new audiences-especially newer forms of radio such as Spotify, Pandora, and Apple Music-means that demand for this career isn ´t going away.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Most independent radio promoters gain their initial connections by working for a radio station in some capacity, or by working an internship in a record label promotion department. Once they've acquired a firm grasp of the different radio formats and developed the connections necessary to get songs onto any music director's desk, they might become record label promotion managers, overseeing radio promotion within a large territory of radio stations, or go freelance to work with clients in the growing unsigned market.
 For some independent radio promoters, success might mean securing a promotion manager position at a large, successful record company-a job that can grant a steadier salary, benefits, and the opportunity to promote big-name artists. For those who enjoy the freedom of working freelance, however, success comes by developing a pervasive network of industry contacts and a rock-solid reputation for promoting tracks by top independent artists. Radio promoters might also use their knowledge and skills to become radio consultants or radio researchers-high-level analysts of airplay trends.
 Finding Work
 Radio promoters might work for record label promotion departments, for independent radio promotion companies, or as freelancers. It ´s difficult to break into this profession, as radio promoters rely on established relationships and connections to do their job. The only way to do so is to make these same relationships and connections in another context, which is why aspiring radio promoters should seek music-related positions within the radio community, or radio-related positions within the record industry.

 Radio promoters are excellent listeners, capable of hearing a record and breaking down its musical appeal to understand which radio stations are most likely to put it into rotation and which markets will benefit it the most.
 At the same time, the real challenge inherent in radio promotion is getting somebody important to listen to the record when there are hundreds of other new releases competing for their attention. To do so, radio promoters must be persuasive, passionate, and persistent-but the latter in such a way that it doesn ´t compromise their connections. After all, there's always the next record. The radio promoters who tend to succeed are unerringly polite, optimistic, and patient, understanding that long-term relationships are far more important than individual placements.
 Work Life
 In the internet age, radio promoters no longer live out of their cars, but the position may still require a fair amount of travel. The bulk of the job consists of meeting and strategizing with artists, sending emails to and phoning radio stations, and paying in-person visits to important stations and markets in order to maintain connections. Networking at music and radio industry events is a must. Radio promoters who choose to go completely freelance do so at the expense of a steady salary and health benefits, but gain the freedom to work wherever and whenever they choose.

Label Manager,52119,Music Business & Management,"label manager, artists, musicians, representative, finance","What does a Label Manager do?
 Although the best teams make it look easy, creating a finished record is a challenging and unruly affair. Enter the label manager, a high-level record label project manager who coordinates the activities of departments and individuals in order to guide a musical project all the way from the early planning stage into the marketplace. For each release, label managers create and implement an overarching schedule and budget. While the label's specialized employees focus in on their individual goals and tasks-creating the album's cover art, for example, or planning a press tour-the label manager's concern is always the big picture: creating a solid, economical product that represents the label well and releases on time.
 Good label managers are organized, detail-oriented, diplomatic, and communicative.
 Although project management is a common thread for all label managers, the day-to-day duties of the job differ greatly depending on the size of the label in question. Managers for small, independent labels might be directly involved in almost every aspect of the label's releases, including marketing, promotion, publicity, distribution, merchandising, licensing, social media management, tour planning, and more. On the other hand, managers at large record label companies delegate these tasks to employees in relevant departments, instead focusing their energy on broad project management and interdepartmental coordination. Major label managers might spend their time coordinating large marketing and promotional pushes, overseeing contract-signing and licensing negotiations, and weighing in on artist management and booking decisions.

Librettist,51120,"Acting, Theatre & Dance","librettist, script, song writer, song, language","What does a Librettist do?
 While composers tend to receive the lion's share of the public's praise and recognition, no musical or opera could be created without the work of a dedicated librettist. A particular variety of playwright who specializes in the intersection between text, music, and theater, librettists exist in two fields-opera and musical theater-where they perform slightly different roles. In either case, the librettist's first job is often to create a ""treatment"": a short document which contains an outline of the characters, story, dramatic structure, and scripted dialogue of the work. If the treatment interests a composer, producer, or director, the librettist might begin to develop a full script-often referred to as the show's libretto or ""book""-without which an opera or musical would simply be a staged concert or song cycle.
 Opera Librettists
 In the field of opera, most librettists either work alone or in collaboration with an opera composer. A new opera might be an entirely original work, a fresh take on historical events, a response to an existing opera, or an adaptation of a myth, play, book, or other work. Because text generally precedes music in this form, opera librettists are often solely responsible for originating the work and subsequently guiding its narrative direction.
 Musical Theater Book Writers
 Similar to opera librettists, the book writers of the musical theater industry create the story, dramatic structure, and text for new musical theater works. Lyrics are a special case, and may fall to the musical composer, a separate lyricist, or the book writer-in which case the book writer can be referred to as the show's librettist. While the book frequently predates the music-particularly in the booming field of musical theater adaptation-book writers on new original musicals sometimes work closely with their composers to develop the music and story simultaneously.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Librettists come from a wide range of backgrounds. Many enter the field through work as a playwright, screenwriter, novelist, or other professional writer. While some are amateur musicians, songwriters, or lyricists whose musical backgrounds help them to collaborate with composers, others don't possess a lick of musical ability-although they do have a vast appreciation for it. Knowledge of, love for, and immersion in either opera or musical theater is in many ways the most important prerequisite for the career. Book writers or librettists might take musical theater adaptation gigs-or turn it into their full-time career.
 Finding Work
 Finding work as a librettist is a twofold process, requiring first partnering with a composer to create a treatment or completed show, and second connecting with a producer, director, company, festival, or artistic director who is interested in producing the finished work. Receiving a residency or commission from a major company or festival could provide a one-time shortcut through the latter step, but more often, getting a show from libretto to the stage requires extensive networking and pitching.
 Cultivating creative partnerships with specific composers can also be highly profitable; historically, many librettists have found success as one half of a duo with a talented composer-Oscar Hammerstein, for example, or W.S. Gilbert.

 Interpersonal Skills
 Librettists are writers and storytellers who are fascinated by the relationship between text, music, and theater. Collaborative skills are key to this profession, which requires responding to and sharing space with the ideas of composers. Good librettists understand that sometimes words tell the story better than music, whereas other times the opposite is true. Because the revision process is essential to producing strong work, successful librettists are sharp, critical editors who aren't afraid to make changes and let go of ideas that don't pan out.
 Work Life
 At the beginning of the process of creating a new work, librettists might work independently wherever, whenever, and however they like to write. If working under commission-whichis the exception, not the rule-they have a responsibility to manage their time effectively and meet deadlines. Once librettists partner with a composer and/or lyricist, they may begin group writing and revision sessions leading up to workshop performances. Once the show is finished and entering its first production, the librettist takes on a new role, working with the producing company to clarify aspects of the story and make last-minute adjustments to the text.

Whether it's the tune that plays when a child pushes a button on a toy, the songs serenading skaters at an ice rink, or the backing track in the latest viral video, nearly all of the musical recordings we hear in our daily lives are owned and copyrighted-and these copyrights are, in turn, serviced by licensing representatives.
 A friendly, outgoing demeanor is an important trait because licensing representatives spend a lot of time talking and meeting with people, discussing music, and making small talk.
 Licensing representatives deal with four kinds of licenses: the mechanical license, which grants the right to record and distribute a song; the public performance license, which grants the right to play a song in a public space; the synchronization license, which grants the right to use a song in a visual media format such as film; and the master license, which grants the right to use a specific recording of a song. Different organizations control different rights, and grant licenses accordingly. Major performance rights organizations (PROs) such as BMI, ASCAP, and SESAC trade in performance licenses, while record companies control master rights, and music publishers usually control both mechanical and synchronization rights.
 This means that licensing representatives do quite different jobs depending on what kind of company they're employed by. Representatives at PROs work in large teams that almost resemble call centers, pitching access to their company's entire catalog to businesses including amusement parks, nightclubs, and radio stations. On the other hand, representatives at record companies, music publishers, music libraries, or copyright administration companies tend to work with creatives who are looking for a certain kind of song or instrumental track to use in a television, film, advertising, or online project. These representatives pitch and field offers for specific artists or tracks in their catalog and, if the pitch is successful, negotiate a fee for the license.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Although general knowledge of licensing laws, contract laws, and the music business is vital to the job, there's no specific education program or degree that qualifies one to jump into a career in licensing. Rather, most licensing representatives begin their careers as interns or assistants in the licensing department of a publishing company, or at an independent copyright administration company. With time and experience, they may advance to the role of representative, and then move up to become the director of the department or company. Licensing representatives might also explore different sides of the industry-working for a PRO is quite different from working for a publisher, for example. Licensing representatives with Hollywood connections are well positioned to become music supervisors.

Live VJ,53121,Motion pictures and broadcasting,"live vj, adaptive, innovative, creative, live, in person, quick thinking","? In the early days of music television channels like MTV and VH1, the term live VJ adapted from disc jockey referred to the medium's newly minted stars who hosted shows, introduced videos, and curated music video playlists. Today, live VJs are working visual artists who create, curate, and improvise videos for live events and performances particularly those that involve music in some way. There are many different ways to approach this hybrid art form; some VJs incorporate other visual arts in their work, like collage, animation, 3D digital design, and lighting design.
 
 Aspiring VJs should aim to build exceptional videography and video editing skills, knowledge of a wide range of music, and a large collection of images, videos, and effects to remix live.
 
 Live VJs have become integral to the clubbing and festival scene, where they might create videos that enhance the DJ's playlist or shoot and manipulate video live as a form of performance. Live VJs might also create video experiences to support an artist's concert tour, a play or piece of performance art, a contemporary staging of a ballet or opera, a fashion show, or other events. In addition, they might display work in a gallery or other fine art setting.
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Live VJs come from a number of educational backgrounds, including film, music, graphic design, and visual art. Most start out working nightclubs and bars, but may book gigs at festivals or even tour alongside a musical artist as they become more established. They could also start taking on contract work for high-profile recording artists going on tour. Additionally, live VJs are well positioned to work in the film industry as video editors or music video directors, in the theater industry as lighting designers, or in a diverse range of industries as interactive media specialists.

Lyricist,51121,"Composition, Scoring, and Songwriting","lyricist, lyrics, song writer, ghost writer, ","What does a Lyricist do?
 For a long time, skilled wordsmiths with a real feel for music were precious commodities in the music publishing world, known for crafting beautiful lines and verses to enhance the work of songwriters and composers. Today, however, professional lyricists are a rare breed in the music industry, pushed out by decreasing revenue, an increasing number of songwriters who pen lyrics for their own tunes, and a generally declining demand for expertly crafted lyrics.
 Lyricists are articulate and detail-oriented, with a keen eye for observing the world around them and the discipline to translate their observations and insights into the formal language of song.
 The changing market for lyrics has required most professional lyricists to metamorphose into new career roles. Those who have an aptitude for singing and coming up with catchy melodies may work in the record industry as top-line songwriters. Similarly, skilled lyricists can be employed by music publishing companies as staff writers, where they work in teams with collaborators who pick up the musical slack. Additionally, a small number of lyricists make it as freelancers, pitching their work to publishers and collaborating with freelance songwriters, freelance composers, advertising and television producers, and music supervisors. In general, however, the days when lyricists could succeed in the recording and publishing industries on the strength of their verbal eloquence-without being able to play an instrument or write melodies-seem to be coming to an end.
 That's not to say that there aren't opportunities for dedicated lyricists elsewhere. In the musical theater industry, lyricists work closely with musical theater composers and book writers to produce finished musicals. They're in especially high demand in the booming field of musical theater adaptation. Similarly, in the medium of opera, librettists are responsible for all of the show's text-which they might create by collaborating with a specific composer or by working on their own, almost as playwrights. Unlike musical theater lyricists, librettists also conceive the plot, characters, and dramatic structure of their librettos.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Very few people work as dedicated lyricists today; those who do tend to work in specific roles like staff writer, top-line songwriter, performing songwriter, librettist, musical theater adapter, or musical theater lyricist. With hard work and dedication, these modern-day lyricist incarnations might write lyrics and melodies for top recording artists, become successful artists themselves on the strength of their own songwriting material, or collaborate on new theater and opera works.
 Finding Work
 Nowadays, there isn ´t much work for dedicated professional lyricists in popular music genres. The notable exception is rap and hip-hop music, wherein many staff lyricists are employed to ghostwrite verses by major artists. Those interested in writing lyrics for pop, country, or R&B songs should pursue staff writing contracts with music publishers or find work as a top-line songwriter.

Lyricists who work in musical theater and opera must understand how to write to reveal character, drive plot, and create a sense of time and place.
 Work Life
 Staff lyricists keep conventional business hours and usually work from the publisher ´s office or studio. Freelance lyricists have the freedom to make their own work hours, as do musical theater lyricists and librettists. Lyricists working in the record and publishing industries are likely to spend their evenings and weekends going out to hear music and network with people in the industry.

Military Musician,51122,Musicians and Singers,"military musician, service, inspiration, pride, serve, country, anthem","? Military musicians are enlisted members of their country's armed forces who play in various ensembles and perform duties related to music stewardship. To take the United States Army as an example, each of the five branches Army, Navy, Air Force Marines, and Coast Guard has several large concert ensembles that resemble orchestras. These large ensembles might also be broken down into smaller groups spanning a wide stylistic range from Dixieland and Celtic to country, calypso, bluegrass, or Baroque. Although military musicians rarely see active combat, on some occasions they may be deployed to conflict zones and all are required to complete basic combat training regardless.
 
 For those who want to work exclusively as a musician and not as a soldier, it's critical that they audition, are accepted for a position, and complete the paperwork before enlisting.
 
 Most military musicians participate in several groups and perform at a host of military functions, including ceremonies, parades, dinner receptions, concerts for troops, and holiday celebrations. In addition to traditional bands, the United States Army also employs a handful of premier bands elite ensembles that perform at prestigious events such as presidential inaugurations, foreign dignitary visits, and funerals at Arlington Cemetery on top of regularly scheduled concerts and tours. While most military musicians are performers first and foremost, many are assigned additional responsibilities such as working in the music library, maintaining an inventory of instruments, providing sound engineering for shows, or composing new pieces.

 Most military musicians are high-level players with experience in concert and/or marching settings. Before joining the army, many military musicians work as orchestra musicians, touring musicians, or general business musicians. Some also possess arranging, composing, or engineering skills.
 
 For those who want to work exclusively as a musician and not as a soldier, it's critical that they audition, are accepted for a position, and complete the paperwork before enlisting. While some enlist and work for a brief period as military musicians before pursuing careers outside the military, working as a military musician can also constitute a career in and of itself. Military musicians cannot be fired or laid off without serious cause, and members of premier bands are guaranteed the position until retirement, at age 55.

Movement Coach,31204,Music Education,"movement coach, instructor, supervisor, goals, body, movement, sport, dance,","What does a Movement Coach do?
 Not to be confused with choreographers, who design and direct dance and stylized movement, movement coaches work with a diverse clientele to address individual movement goals or to impart a specific movement technique, such as Alexander Technique, Dalcroze Eurhythmics, or Williamson Technique. Recognizing the potential of movement practice and training to unlock new levels of artistic expression, movement coaches can work with musicians, dancers, choreographers, actors, teachers, students, opera and ballet companies, orchestras, theater companies, chamber ensembles, and many other groups. However, most movement coaches choose one or two of these clientele groups in which to specialize, and focus their teachings around only one or two schools of movement.
 Movement coaches typically have experience in the performing arts and training in one or more physical training pedagogies.
 Every movement coach is different, and so is every client. For example, actors preparing for a movie or stage role might turn to a movement coach to help them adopt their character's physical mannerisms and movements, or to find a movement-based anchor that connects with a character's psychological and emotional life. Musicians, on the other hand, might come to movement coaches for help connecting with their bodies, improving their playing posture, or solving a persistent movement-based problem. Each client has their own concerns, from dancers and performance artists looking to expand their movement vocabulary, to teachers searching for new classroom methods, to animators and stop-motion project directors looking to imbue characters with realistic and compelling movement. And then there are group clients-usually performance ensembles-that movement coaches train, helping them to polish their repertoire and reach their highest potential.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Movement coaches typically have experience in a few performing arts disciplines. Most start in dance-a discipline that focuses on movement and physicality-and progress to applying their training and knowledge to other forms of expression. More important than any educational degree is training in one or more physical movement pedagogies. Successful movement coaches may end up establishing their own schools or systems of movement that reflect their principles, or partner with prestigious dance companies and performance groups.
 Finding Work
 Most movement coaches work as independent contractors with both individual and group clients. In addition to regular clients, they may find additional work leading workshops, seminars, and master classes. Because work is generally found via word-of-mouth recommendation, networking with industry professionals and building a solid reputation and r sum  are critical for movement coaches.

 Work Life
 As freelancers, movement coaches will typically piece together a number of distinct gigs to make a living. This means they may need to travel significant distances from job to job, in which case it helps to have an independent source of transportation. Because performing artists make up the core of a movement coach's clientele, they will also often spend at least a few nights a week networking in the performing arts scene, or at the very least will stay abreast of local performing groups and artists.

Music Agent,11202,Music Business & Management,"music agent, connections, people-person, relationships, collaborative, ","What does a Music Agent do?
 Music agents work with artists to schedule concerts, tours, and in-person appearances, and to negotiate fees and contracts for those bookings. For up-and-coming clients, this may mean working the phones to book a string of club dates or secure an opening slot with a more established act. For bigger artists, it could mean planning national or world tours, scheduling radio and television appearances, and securing advertising deals or sponsorships. Whatever the case, developing relationships with talent buyers, promoters, festival organizers, and venue managers is a vital part of any agent ´s job, as is becoming intimately familiar with the musical style, clientele, ownership, and support services of music venues across the nation.
 In this relationship-driven field, communication skills are a must, along with the confidence and assertiveness to be a sharp negotiator on behalf of one's client.
 Working as an agent is a bit like piecing together a puzzle: coordinating nights, towns, and venues while competing for bookings against all the other acts on the road at the same time, and being careful to create a manageable itinerary. In addition to scheduling, agents spend a large amount of time cutting deals for their clients, which means a large chunk of the workday is spent talking on the phone, emailing, and taking meetings. Agents may also oversee travel logistics and hospitality (hotels and meals) for artists who are on the road.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 This is often described as a ""mail room career,"" meaning that agents might start in low-level positions (the proverbial mail room) and work their way up by demonstrating talent and hard work. Whether or not this is the path for everyone, it's certainly true that getting one's foot in the door-as an intern or assistant in the agency-is perhaps the most important part of becoming a music agent. Some large agencies also have in-house agent training programs. Experienced music agents often go on to start their own booking agencies, where they serve a number of high-profile clients.

 Breaking into this career is not easy. Usually, it requires getting a lower-level position at an agency-such as an internship or assistantship-and learning on the job while waiting for the big break: the opportunity to manage one's own client.

 Music contractors are best known in the film and television industries, where they ´re responsible for finding the session players and conductor to record a film score, television score, or a show ´s theme. However, they can also work in the theater industry-finding pit orchestra musicians for a play, musical, or opera-or in the live and recorded music industries, where they might hire backup singers and touring musicians for a recording artist or music director, or connect a songwriter recording an album with skilled session musicians. In all cases, these musical matchmakers thrive in the space between industries, reaching across the divide to connect supply-seasoned musicians and conductors-with demand.
 In order to do their job, music contractors must be good at making new connections, maintaining old ones, and leaving a positive impression in any social encounter, no matter how brief.
 In addition to connecting musicians with clients seeking musical talent, music contractors also act as liaisons between the musicians, the client, and the union. It's their job to ensure that the musicians they provide work under good conditions and receive fair pay. Contractors may also facilitate contract agreements for the musicians, book studio time if the job involves a recording, and assist in the recording process if necessary. In order to field a wide range of requests, music contractors must be able to supply musicians who work in every genre and on every instrument, no matter how obscure.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 It must be emphasized that this is a late-career position for a former professional musician who has worked in and around a specific industry for a long time. Music contractors build their local professional network-which is their primary product-out of a long list of peers and collaborators from their previous career. But while any working musician in Hollywood will likely encounter a music contractor at some time or another, there's a reason that few will enter this career themselves: there simply isn't enough work to support many music contractors in a single industry. In Hollywood, for example, only a handful of impressively well-connected music contractors broker the majority of work for musicians in the industry-and the proliferation of sampling technology has only decreased this number.
 Finding Work
 It's very rare for an individual to actively attempt to find work as a music contractor. Most music contractors find their way into this niche field after a long career as a professional session musician, conductor, pit musician, or touring musician, during which time they make thorough connections among the local music community. It's these preexisting connections that music contractors use to do their job when they retire from playing music.

 Interpersonal Skills
 The product that music contractors sell is their connections. They not only need to know the best local musicians on every instrument, but also who among them is currently available for work, who works well together and who can't be in the same room, and who could fill in when someone gets sick. In order to gain this knowledge, music contractors must be sociable, attentive, and good at making new connections and maintaining old ones.
 Being a skilled music contractor also means balancing two sides that are often at odds: the musicians who are looking for honest, well-paid work, and the clients who are looking for excellent (and cheap) musical labor. Good judgment is critical.
 Work Life
 Travel is minimal for music contractors, as most duties can be performed at a home office in Los Angeles or New York City. But like many freelance positions, this job comes with its fair share of unofficial job duties, such as constant networking at industry parties and events in order to stay on top of the scene. Music contractors must, by necessity, lead an active and engaged social life; any contractor who ceases to actively pursue new contacts may be pushed out of the scene quickly.

Church music directors, also called choir directors, are professional bandleaders and administrators hired by churches to lead the choir and develop the church's music-oriented activities. Their job varies based on the structure of the churchÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ­s music department and the goals of the minister, but almost always involves scheduling and leading choir rehearsals; conducting and leading the choir in performance; recruiting and auditioning new singers and volunteers; fostering each singerÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ­s musical growth; and appointing senior choir members to become section leaders, soloists, and assistant conductors. Music directors also choose the choir's performance pieces, prepare special programs for holidays or special occasions, and work alongside the church organist (if they don't play organ themselves). Some church choirs are highly competitive, and planning for competitions might also be part of the job.
 
 Excellent interpersonal skills are a must, as are the patience, clarity, and ease of communication necessary to teach well.
 
 Besides leading the choir, the music director has a number of administrative duties, including creating a budget for the music program (which might pay for robes, sheet music, travel, set, and staging), performing administrative work, and maintaining weekly office hours. In addition, music directors might be involved in developing the church's music programs further by leading a small music class at an associated Sunday school, planning local performances and choir showcases, or training a separate church or gospel band (which typically includes instruments like guitar and drums). Finally, music directors connect the church to the broader community of church music by attending conferences and seminars to bring back new pieces, techniques, and literature for development of the music department and singers.
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Most church music directors are trained musicians and singers who grew up singing choir music. Some work as church organists or choir singers before finding music director positions. For many, working as a church music director is a part-time music position and is combined with other work or study. Unless they're working in the world of competitive choir music, music directors are unlikely to have many opportunities for direct career advancement. However, gradually building up a churchÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ­s music programs can be just as rewarding as climbing a career ladder. Ultimately, church music directors use their job experience to lead school, community, and professional choirs, and many become professional music or voice teachers.

On the other hand, choir directors for small churches may work part-time hours, or a full-time schedule with ample free time to develop new music initiatives.

Multitalented musicians who work with performers in every style of music, music directors bring the skills and knowledge of a producer, arranger, and performing musician together in a single package. While they work in a broad range of situations, they are most frequently hired to prepare a band for a concert or tour. The music director for a solo pop act such as Miley Cyrus or Lorde, for example, auditions and selects the touring musicians and backup singers who will support the star, creates and teaches arrangements to the musicians, and shapes the music in rehearsals during the weeks before the performance. In some cases, the music director may even play alongside the musicians, although this is more common for bandleaders.
 
 A music director must be able to comprehend another artist's vision, have the personal and musical skills to communicate that vision to others, and be able to build a deep sense of collegiality among the players in an ensemble.
 
 With extensive knowledge of music technology, composition, and performance, musical directors are responsible for shaping every aspect of the musical performance, from the general such as the feel or aim of an arrangement to the specific like which effects pedal to use during a solo. During performances, the music director cues entrances and transitions, integrates prerecorded tracks in the live show, and is the point person for resolving musical, technical, and sometimes personal issues among the band. If a singer decides at 4:00 p.m. to add a cover tune to that night's set list, it's the job of his or her music director to make sure everyone knows the arrangement by show time. Other duties may include writing charts, collecting and distributing pay to band members, and overseeing communications among the band.

 Career Path
 Many music directors get their start by assuming a leadership position within their own bands: auditioning and hiring players, crafting arrangements, and leading rehearsals. Ultimately, what's important is being well-versed in the process of building and running a tight live show. With experience and a solid reputation, music directors may advance to better-paying gigs with more prominent performers or take jobs in television and film, directing talent shows like American Idol or major broadcast events such as the Oscars or the Super Bowl halftime show.
 
 Finding Work
 In order to even be considered for a music director position, one needs to have a proven track record as a performing musician, arranger, or bandleader preferably all of the above. If the position is for a tour, then touring experience is essential. Once a music director is established, finding work is largely a function of effective networking and a reputation for solid, dependable work. Music directors can also find work in the television and musical theater industries.

Being detail-oriented, organized, and prepared is vital both for maximizing rehearsal efficiency and handling the performance, when anything could happen.
 
 Work Life
 The lifestyle of a music director tends to be essentially the same as that of a touring musician: extended periods away from home, traveling from city to city to play for new audiences every night.

 At its core, the music director ´s job is to understand how songs and music serve a show ´s story, setting, drama, and emotional context, and to bring out those critical elements in high quality and consistent performances. As a member of the show ´s central creative team-alongside the stage director, composer, librettist, and choreographer-the music director is hard at work from the very beginning of the production process: developing an overall vision for the production's music, leading the musical aspects of the audition process, helping cast actors and singers, and selecting and hiring pit orchestra musicians-possibly with the help of a music contractor.
 The best music directors are simultaneously leaders and team players, understanding when to take charge and when to accomodate another's creative vision.
 As the rehearsal process begins, the music director personally schedules and oversees separate music rehearsals for the cast and orchestra. During cast rehearsals-which could consist of the full cast or various smaller groups and configurations of singers-the music director or repetiteur accompanies on piano, while during orchestra rehearsals the director conducts. Whether working with instrumentalists or singers, the music director strives to shape and blend their sound, create a shared sense of ensemble, and develop a unique musical interpretation. The music director is also likely to consult with the show's sound designer on technical aspects of the performance. Once the production opens, the music director's duties include leading warm-ups before each show, conducting the orchestra in performance, and holding occasional rehearsals to maintain consistency and incorporate notes from the stage manager.

 Career Path
 The music director is the highest musical position on a musical theater or opera production. Qualified individuals have many years of industry experience as a conductor, pit orchestra musician, or repetiteur, and generally start out directing community and college productions before moving on to regional and, ultimately, professional ones. Some go on to become arrangers, composers, or musical theater adapters, while others advance in their careers by directing productions for increasingly prestigious musical theater or opera companies.
 Finding Work
 Generally speaking, theatrical music directors are freelancers who might be hired by theater companies, opera companies, or universities. However, music directors for opera often have a close relationship with a particular opera house or company, and may even be full-time employees. Similarly, a broadway music director might work in-house for a particular company. Aspiring music directors should network with producers, directors, and artistic directors, and always keep in mind that musical theater is more than just Broadway; there's a wealth of other opportunities out there, from musical theater productions done by community and regional theaters to experimental plays, hybrid performance art, and immersive theatrical experiences.

 Work Life
 As for many who work in the theater, short periods of intensity-like in the frenzied weeks leading up to opening night-alternate with opportunities for relaxation, regrouping, networking, and acquiring new skills. This could present a challenge for some, but those with a passion for theater tend to relish the highs and lows of putting on a large, collaborative production.

 Much like traditional librarians, music librarians organize, catalogue, and maintain collections; select rare materials for acquisition; oversee preservation processes; answer reference inquiries; and teach people how to interact with the library. They may also plan exhibits and concerts, as well as organize lectures, classes, and other public programs.
 A broad education in music and the liberal arts is an essential foundation for working as a music librarian, as is sufficient knowledge of German and at least one Romance language.
 Beyond these essential tasks, music librarians perform a number of additional duties based on the institutions where they work and-to a certain extent-their own interests. Music librarians employed by a major symphony, for example, oversee a collection of orchestral scores and other performance materials specific to the ensemble. Those who work at a conservatory's or university's music library devote part of their workday to ordering and distributing materials to be used by student ensembles, opera workshops, and other campus performing groups. Military librarians prepare music for Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard band performances, edit program notes, and maintain historic archives for the military's many music ensembles.
 Regardless of employer, a music librarian might also participate actively in music scholarship, pursuing their own research and writing reviews for journals, or join committees involved in discussing professional issues such as electronic information storage and cataloguing standards.

 Career Path
 A broad education in music and the liberal arts is an essential foundation for working as a music librarian, as is sufficient knowledge of German and at least one Romance language. Additionally, employers typically require a master's degree in a field like library or information science, although a degree in a musical field-such as composition-can't hurt. Many music librarians start out as student assistants or interns before pursuing the career full-time.
 With time and experience, some music librarians move into administrative positions within their organizations, while others pursue educational activities or focus on research and publishing.
 Finding Work
 Music librarians are employed by research libraries; university, college, and conservatory libraries; public libraries; radio and television libraries; music publishers; music societies and foundations; orchestras and ensembles; and all five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. Music librarians in the military must be enlisted soldiers.
 Aspiring music librarians can get a feel for the job by volunteering or working part-time at a campus music library.

Music Merchandiser,52119,Music Business & Management,"music merchandiser, product, designer, marketing, advertisement","What does a Music Merchandiser do?
 As record sales have declined in the age of music streaming, the value of strong merchandising for musicians and artists has only increased. This is the age of the music merchandiser: a jack-of-all-trades graphic designer and company leader who creates designs for recording artists, applies these designs to a variety of products-from T-shirts to toothbrushes-and oversees product manufacturing, whether it's taking place in a DIY basement studio or a bona fide warehouse.
 Music merchandisers who consistently design high-quality, on-trend artwork and manufacture solid products eventually build up large rosters of clients.
 When it comes to handling artists' merchandising needs, music merchandisers do it all: even selling the merchandise directly to consumers in their own online stores, a process which was traditionally performed by record label field merchandisers going store to store. Some music merchandising companies offer touring services-merchandising road managers who travel with artists to oversee the sale and stock of merchandise. Additionally, music merchandisers sometimes provide brand consulting services for artists and organize merchandising promotions such as pop-up stores.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Most music merchandisers start out as freelance graphic designers, doing everything themselves: creating designs, screen printing T-shirts, and building online stores for clients. After some time, they may accrue enough funds to purchase new facilities and build a staff, becoming business owners. At this point, a music merchandiser might choose to begin licensing designs from other artists, outsourcing manufacturing to a separate manufacturer, or keeping everything in-house. Over time, music merchandising companies that consistently create high-quality, on-trend products can accrue impressively large rosters of clients and sell their products in stores across the world.
 Finding Work
 Music merchandising companies are usually broken up into a number of distinct departments, including art design, tour coordination, product management, artist relations, and licensing. Job openings for existing music merchandising companies can be found on general job listing websites like Indeed, Monster, and Glassdoor. That being said, many aspiring merchandisers get their start by designing and creating products by themselves in home studios, and develop an initial network of clients by approaching recording artists and their managers at shows.

 Music merchandisers tend to be jack-of-all-trades graphic designers with some knowledge of marketing, manufacturing, sales, and licensing. In order to make strong designs, they need to be immersed in music, graphic design, and pop-culture trends. They must be style chameleons, capable of understanding the particular graphic cultures associated with certain genres of music and mimicking them while creating designs that are innovative and distinct. In addition, many designs are created collaboratively, and some come with direct specifications from clients themselves, so active listening and strong communication skills are a must.
 Work Life
 Freelance music merchandisers work flexible hours and usually balance the creative process with a day job-at least at the beginning. On the other hand, owners or employees of established music merchandising companies are much more likely to work normal business hours from an office or studio. In some cases, the job involves traveling with artists on tour and managing their merchandise sales.

 Career Path
 There are three prerequisites to applying for a job as a college or conservatory professor: one must be a skilled artist, an experienced instructor, and a graduate of a master's or doctoral degree program. Many begin their higher-education teaching careers while still enrolled in graduate school, as teaching assistants (or T.A.s). Some gain additional educational experience by working as middle or high school music teachers, or private instructors.
 Successful college or conservatory professors can move up the ranks from untenured guest positions to tenured full faculty ones, and eventually become the head or chair of their departments. From there, one can choose to become a higher education administrator.
 Finding Work
 There are numerous varieties and levels of teaching positions at conservatories, colleges, and universities, from guest lecturer to department chair. Positions are either tenured, which means permanent, or untenured, which means they may be renewed at the discretion of the institution and relevant deans.
 Adjunct professor, lecturer, and instructor are untenured positions, while assistant professor, associate professor, and professor are tenured or tenure-track positions. Aspiring music professors should look online for open candidate searches, and network with higher-education administrators and other music professors to increase the chance of being chosen for a position.
 If one is struggling to land a tenured post such as associate or full professor, untenured adjunct professor positions are always plentiful and should be considered. Many institutions also have online-only programs, which often accept instructors with industry experience.

The best teachers balance their high expectations for students with patience and understanding.
 Work Life
 Depending on their position within the faculty, a professor might teach only a handful of private lessons and a master class, leaving plenty of time for personal projects and other work, or may carry a full teaching schedule and attend evening concerts, performances, and recitals on top of that, leaving time for little else.
 Professors might live on campus or commute from elsewhere, with more significant travel a possibility. While untenured positions generally offer lower pay, minimal or no benefits, and no job security, they also provide freedom and flexibility for teachers with active performing careers.

 Music publishers have-to put it in the simplest possible terms-two primary jobs: to commercially leverage a musical work and to get the composer or songwriter paid for it. In exchange for a cut of an artist's profits, they navigate the labyrinth of laws and regulations that is the world of copyright management.
 Publishers seek out contracts with songwriters and composers at every stage of their careers, scouring clubs and the web for new talent as well as courting established artists. In exchange for a percentage of ownership of their current or future work, publishers provide these artists with numerous services. These include promoting and placing the client's compositions with recording artists looking for material; landing a client's song in a film, television show, video game, advertisement, or other media; monitoring royalties paid by record companies for the rights to produce CDs and create downloadable content; and properly registering compositions with a performing-rights organization like BMI

 Music publishers administer all the various revenue streams that flow toward songwriters and composers, each of which has a separate, complicated, and shifting fee structure. Some publishers are quite involved in the creative process, contracting talented staff writers to produce a steady stream of new material; others are largely administrative, cutting publishing deals with songwriters but doing a minimum of promotion on their behalf. Other duties include clearing material to ensure that there is no copyright infringement attached to the catalog and having compositions transcribed to print.

"Music Supervisor (Film, TV, Video Games)",52119,Music Business & Management,"music supervisor (film, tv, video games), administrator, creative, directors, vision, style","What does a Music Supervisor (Film, TV, Video Games) do?
 A recently popularized field, music supervision is the art of selecting and licensing preexisting songs or recordings for use in visual media like film, television, video games, and advertising. A skilled music supervisor might choose the perfect song to enhance a dramatic television moment, help an advertising producer make smart, inspired music choices, or find a cost-effective workaround when a film's plot requires a particularly expensive, hard-to-license recording. Music might be selected based around a central guiding aesthetic, a sense of how the music would complement a specific scene, or knowledge that a certain new track is well positioned to succeed.
 Music supervisors must possess a natural sense of the emotional and narrative nuance of music, lots of experience with music synchronization and licensing, and strong verbal communication skills.
 In order to use a piece of pre-existing music-a song or recording-music supervisors must negotiate the rights and costs with licensing representatives employed by record labels, music publishers, and the original artists or songwriters themselves. Sometimes these negotiations are purely about cost, whereas others it's about convincing the artist-who may not like the project or the music's context within it-to license the song at all. When music placements are successful, the results typically benefit both camps: the songwriters, artists, and record label receive exposure and royalties, while the movie, television, or video game producers piggyback on the value of the artist's brand, or simply use the emotional depth and poignancy of the music to tell their stories.
 In addition to selecting and licensing music, music supervisors might also draw up a production's list of musical credits, maintain cue sheets, and take part in spotting sessions-meetings with the project's director, composer, and music editor during which the details of the music's placement, style, tone, and duration are discussed. If the project necessitates recording a cover version of a song-often the case for famous songs with expensive or unattainable licenses-the music supervisor oversees the entire process, including recruiting and contracting musical talent, booking the studio, and attending the recording sessions. In rare cases, a music supervisor may act as the music director for the project, hiring the composer and overseeing the direction of the score in addition to the soundtrack.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 As a professional field, music supervision has only come into the spotlight relatively recently, making it difficult to define a typical career path for a music supervisor. Music supervisors tend to be musically trained, extremely well connected, and knowledgeable about music licensing practices. However, the only real job requirement is to be an avid music listener with connections in the music industry (and failing that, persistence and dedication). The most successful music supervisors can be paid large sums for a single project and rarely lack for work.
 There is some crossover between music supervision and music coordination, a similar, but more administratively-oriented, field.
 Finding Work
 Aspiring music supervisors should do whatever they can to get their first credits-performing music supervision for student films, for example. Keep in mind that music supervision isn't just about picking the right song for the job; it's also about negotiating the rights to the song, a task that requires strong professional connections and a reputation in the music licensing world. Aspiring music supervisors might consider doing an internship at a music publisher, possibly in the licensing department.

 Interpersonal Skills
 Music supervisors possess an unusually far-reaching and diverse knowledge of music history and recording artists, an intuitive sense of the emotional nuance of music, and a developed relationship with visual media. Generally, they are people who seek out, listen to, and remember as much music as they possibly can, and can organize and recall this information at will. In addition, music supervisors should be excellent communicators with strong networking skills. Finally, it's helpful to be tapped into the cultural and musical zeitgeist, with natural instincts about musical and visual trends.
 Work Life
 Most high-profile music supervisors are freelancers who work on a project-by-project basis. However, music supervisors can also be employed by production companies; film, television, and video game studios; advertising companies; or even small music-supervision companies. The majority are based in either Los Angeles or New York City.
 Unsurprisingly, work hours for music supervisors vary considerably. As they don't necessarily need an office for their work, many work from home or do the majority of their job on the go, moving from meeting to meeting. On the other hand, music supervisors who are acting as full-time music directors for a show or movie tend to be much more involved in the filming process and almost always spend some time on location.

 It's impossible to overstate the impact and importance of music teachers-not just on aspiring musicians but also on the continued evolution of music culture and tradition. In addition to helping develop instrumental technique, music educators offer their students a richer understanding of music-both history and theory-an avenue for self-expression, and a host of cognitive benefits including enhanced language development, fine motor skills, memory, and academic achievement. They also lead school bands and orchestras, picking and developing the repertoire and shaping the performance as a conductor.
 Those who work as general music teachers are expected to be proficient in many instruments and have a diverse skillset including conducting, composition, improvisation, and more.
 Music is a core part of PK ¬12 education around the world. School music teachers work in a variety of settings and with a vast range of students, from preschoolers banging a drum for the first time to accomplished pianists perfecting Beethoven's sonatas. A music teacher might adhere to a particular instruction method, such as Suzuki or KodÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€°Ã‚Â¬Ã‚Â°ly, or simply tailor lessons to the needs and desires of their students.
 Most focus on instrumental and vocal technique, reading sheet music, ensemble coaching, and helping students prepare for concerts, recitals, and auditions. A teacher may begin a kindergartner's music education with an exploration of city and nature sounds, singing nursery rhymes, and mimicking dynamics with body movements before introducing instrument instruction (in the United States it's often recorder or keyboard), classes in the elements and history of music, and ensembles such as chorus, orchestra, and jazz band.

Certification and licensing practices vary from state to state, so aspiring music teachers should be sure to obtain information about certification exams and license transfers at each state's Department of Education website.
 Music teachers might specialize in common instruments-as piano teachers or chorus teachers, for example-or in a specific age or type of student, such as early childhood education or adaptive arts education. Those who work as general music teachers are expected to be proficient in many instruments and have a diverse skill set that includes conducting, composition, and more. As they gain significant experience and respect, music teachers might move from the classroom to a department head position, overseeing the school's, or perhaps the entire district's, music curriculum.
 Finding Work
 Music teachers work at public and private schools, music academies, community music schools, and for-profit music programs.

As part of the degree, music therapy students complete 1,200 hours of clinical training with a variety of populations, including a specialized internship at a site that meets the standards of the American Music Therapy Association. After graduating, they take a certification exam administered by the Certification Board for Music Therapists, or the CBMT to earn the credentials necessary to practice professionally.
 
 In order to advance within the field, music therapists must continue professional development in the forms of clinical supervision, continuing-education credits, and advanced certifications. Today, more and more music therapists are seeking graduate degrees in music therapy, which open up opportunities in advanced clinical training, research, and academia. Music therapists may also incorporate other art forms into their practice, becoming creative arts therapists or expressive arts therapists.
 
 Finding Work
 Music therapists are employed in a wide variety of settings, including medical, mental health, hospice, rehabilitation, educational, and correctional facilities. Additionally, they may be employed in nursing homes, community centers, nonprofits, private practices, and independent music therapy companies. 
 
 The world of music therapy is growing rapidly. Music therapists are advised to network within their field through alumni groups and industry organizations such as the American Music Therapy Association (AMTA), as well as by attending national and regional conferences.

Musical Theater Adapter,51120,"Acting, Theatre & Dance","musical theater adapter, sampling, collaborative, expounding, inspiration ","What does a Musical Theater Adapter do?
 Musical theater adapters take existing materials-like a beloved album, a popular TV show, a graphic novel, or even a famous piece of poetry-and create from them wholly new works of musical theater. These multitalented creators are capable of performing the role of composer, arranger, or librettist depending on the needs of the adaptation: writing an original stage script around an existing album, for example, or creating entirely new songs and lyrics to match the story and characters of a book or other nonmusical source. They also work with the original material, rearranging, rewriting, and recontextualizing it to improve the flow and cohesiveness of the musical.
 This is a booming field; new musical adaptations actually outnumber new original musicals and many are highly successful.
 As arrangers, musical theater adapters are musical tailors, capable of refashioning a three-minute piano tune into an eight-minute production number, retrofitting a collection of Jazz Age standards to suit a show ´s story points, or expanding a song by four bars in the third verse because the character singing it needs more time to cross the stage.
 In addition to composing original songs and arranging existing ones, their work frequently involves interpolation-that is, adding new music based on existing phrases and themes in order to create an affecting fusion of sound and story. Musical theater adapters work closely with composers, directors, music directors, choreographers, orchestrators, and librettists, and frequently partner or work in teams with other adapters.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 There ´s no single degree that can qualify one to work as a musical theater adapter; what ´s needed are proven songwriting and storywriting abilities. Musical theater adapters might work as accompanists, pit orchestra musicians, composers, librettists, arrangers, music directors, or even recording artists for many years before performing their first adaptation.
 This is a booming field; new musical adaptations actually outnumber new original musicals and many are highly successful. Experienced musical theater adapters might become industry mainstays, writing multiple smash hits for Broadway or London ´s West End, or use their reputation to transition into the film industry.
 Finding Work
 In this people-oriented field, where jobs are rarely posted publicly, networking and building a reputation are essential to finding work. Musical theater adapters might be commissioned by theater companies or hired by theater producers to adapt a particular work. They might also create an adaptation independently while soliciting funding from producers and investors. However, aspiring adapters should keep in mind that musical theater isn ´t just Broadway: experimental plays, hybrid performance art, and immersive theatrical experiences can all be sources of work, as can Hollywood.

 Interpersonal Skills
 Unsurprisingly, adaptability is an essential skill for adapters, who must alter every aspect of their own writing to seamlessly camouflage with the source material. Critical analysis, research, and empathy are equally fundamental to this work, the core of which lies in accurately identifying and developing the underlying themes and ideas in the source material-the very things that have made it resonate with audiences in the past.
 Work Life
 Musical theater adapters might complete their work from a desk in a home office, a home music studio, a private studio, a cafe, or anywhere else they can use a laptop. Most of the work is done independently or in collaboration with an adaptation partner or team, and is usually completed long before the musical will be staged.
 Still, musical theater adapters might be involved in the rehearsal and staging process, making changes and modifications to improve the show ´s flow and address problems with the score, script, or lyrics. In between projects, which can be intense and fast-paced, musical theater adapters have the opportunity to relax, regroup, develop new skills, network, and prepare for the next project.

Musicologist,41409,"Librarians, archivists, conservators and curators","musicologist, scholar, specialist, history, theory, culture, politic, political, ","What does a Musicologist do?
 Musicologists are scholars of music who consider the relationship between music and various subjects including geography, aesthetics, politics, race theory, gender theory, neuropsychology, and more. While most work as music professors at conservatories or universities, musicologists lack the technique-based approach most commonly associated with teaching music, instead preferring to view music through the lens of a social science.
 Ethnomusicologists, for example, study music in its cultural context, while cognitive musicologists examine how music manifests in the brain. Music historians, a large and highly diverse subgroup of musicologists, study music from a historical point of view, conducting archival and biographical work, researching performance practices, and exploring the function of music in societies.
 Competition for jobs in academia is high, so in addition to the appropriate degrees and credentials musicologists need to know how to market themselves to stand out from the packs of applicants for teaching posts.
 Musicologists who work as professors spend most of their time on typical scholarly pursuits: conducting research, teaching at the college or graduate level, and authoring articles and books to present their work. Others find preservation work at libraries, museums, or archives. In recent years, musicologists have found a number of new opportunities and applications for their knowledge, such as offering their services as expert witnesses in copyright infringement lawsuits, or working at organizations that create audio recognition software and music recommendation apps. Musicologists might also consult for music publishing and licensing companies on matters of original music clearance, sample analysis, copyright valuation, and verification of originality; they might also advise directors, music supervisors, and advertisers on the historical and stylistic accuracy of music in television, films, and advertisements.

Nonprofit Artist,51122,Musicians and Singers,"nonprofit artist, independent, passion, performer, nonprofit","What does a Nonprofit Artist do?
 While it's often said that simply creating art makes the world a better place, some-like nonprofit artists-desire a more direct approach. These professional musicians, dancers, writers, and theater artists use arts performance and education as tools to spread social justice messages, raise money for important causes, cultivate empathy and understanding in conflict areas, and introduce disenfranchised populations to the transformative power of art in non-traditional settings like hospitals, prisons, rehabilitation centers, community centers, and homeless shelters. They not only work with and for arts-based nonprofit organizations, but also frequently create and helm them.
 Arts-based nonprofits have widely varying goals and methods, and nonprofit artists come from an equally broad range of backgrounds. Some are teaching artists who educate marginalized groups, while others are music, dance, or drama therapists who work with clients who could not otherwise afford their services. Similarly, some nonprofit artists are professional performers-actors, dancers, and musicians-who put on shows for audiences who wouldn't have access to high-level performing arts otherwise, or organize and produce concerts and performances to raise money for specific causes. There are also music librarians and musicologists who work with museums, schools, and research institutes to improve cultural conservation, education, and our understanding of the arts.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Nonprofit artists come from a wealth of professional backgrounds, including performance, education, cultural preservation, and arts therapy. Some contribute their efforts to an existing nonprofit, while others found their own organization to tackle a specific problem that they see going unaddressed. While employees can advance within their organization by taking on increased responsibilities, leaders of nonprofit organizations generally aim to expand or solidify their organization's operations, usually by acquiring increased funding from grants and donors. With their combined focus on performance, education, and management, nonprofit artists might be well positioned to direct arts-education programs later in their careers.
 Finding Work
 Nonprofit artists might be founders and leaders of their own nonprofit groups, outside artists who partner with an existing nonprofit to deliver a performance or teach a class, or employees who are hired in a part-time or entry-level capacity. Artists who are interested in working with nonprofits are advised to check out nonprofit-specific job sites like Idealist

The best nonprofit artists are also fantastic team players, understanding that working with or for a nonprofit organization sometimes means performing in a setting that's less than ideal, dealing with a lack of resources, or taking on duties that are outside of one's job description.
 Work Life
 In the nonprofit world, there's often an expectation that team members will fulfill multiple roles, provide and acquire a number of skills to serve the organization, or even put in as much time as is needed without guarantee of overtime payment. Performers may double as costumers, administrators may run the sound board during performances, and executives may find themselves working in the office late at night, applying for grants and taking care of payroll. Still, it's work done in service of a greater cause, which is why nonprofit employees are often among the most gratified and fulfilled in the world. Those who work for more established arts nonprofits may perform more distinct roles and be grouped into specific departments.

Opera Singer,51122,Musicians and Singers,"opera singer, hall, concert, classical, opera, operatic, vocals, costume, makeup, ","? Opera singers are highly trained performers whose particular and unusual set of skills arises from the demands of their art form. Contrary to the name, opera singers do more than sing; just as opera combines music and theater, opera singers merge their astounding musical skill with impressive acting and movement ability in order to bring the work of librettists and composers to life.
 
 When not in rehearsal for a show or during the off-season, opera singers spend much of their time learning new material.
 Whether cast as a soloist or a chorus member, an opera singer's work on a production begins with theatrical rehearsals, in which performers focus on reading and interpreting the text almost as if it were a play. Concurrently, soloists, chorus members, and the orchestra gather for separate musical rehearsals under the direction of the conductor, who is frequently also the production's music director. In the final weeks leading up to opening night, opera singers may spend as many as six hours each day in rehearsals, with soloists often receiving additional one-on-one instruction from a vocal coach or r p titeur. 
 
 Just like actors, opera singers do a large amount of off-stage work in order to prepare for the final performance. This includes learning entrances and exits, mastering props and set elements, memorizing blocking and lyrics, and whatever else is necessary in order to successfully inhabit their character. Additionally, opera singers must master their musical parts and find cohesion with the orchestra and other singers. As if that weren't enough, due to the fact that most operas are in Italian, French, German, English, or Russian, opera singers must also practice diction and learn to express themselves emotionally in a tongue that's not their own. As a result of these varied and particular job requirements, there's no other profession like opera singing in the world.
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 In the United States, many aspiring opera singers follow a well-trod path: earn a music degree from a college or conservatory, attend graduate school, land a spot in a selective young artist program, spend years auditioning and entering competitions, and, eventually, find consistent work singing small roles. At this point there's a divide between those who are comfortable singing chorus parts and those who pursue the spotlight as soloists. For the luckiest and most talented, each gig will lead to a bigger, better one with a more prestigious opera company. Although some singers carve out less conventional career paths, the bottom line is that this profession requires thorough training, financial resources, and many years to become established.
 
 Finding Work
 Becoming a permanent chorus member of an opera company can provide full-time employment and benefits, but many prefer to pursue soloist parts as a freelancer. For college graduates, young artist programs are usually the next step to building a career in opera. Most prominent opera houses and companies have these programs, which essentially function as residencies, giving talented singers an opportunity to improve their craft and make connections with established professionals. These connections are vital as, generally speaking, finding auditions and work opportunities requires tapping into a network of opera professionals.

 Work Life
 Opera soloists with flourishing careers may spend as many as 10 months each year on the road, while chorus singers with full-time positions typically perform six days per week, averaging 170 performances during the opera season. Chorus members may also join traveling productions, but are less likely to travel internationally.
 
 All opera singers work nights, in addition to rehearsal and other daytime activities. When not in rehearsal for a show, or during the off-season, opera singers spend much of their time learning new material, translating text, studying and improving their languages, developing their acting skills, and attending to their most vital task: caring for and cultivating their voice.",https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/opera-singer
Orchestra Musician,51122,Musicians and Singers,"orchestra musician, section member, strings, ensemble, performance, stage, crowd","? For many classically trained musicians, landing a permanent position in an orchestra is the dream. Perhaps this is because orchestra positions provide job security, a good salary, medical benefits, and the opportunity to play regularly with other outstanding musicians. Or perhaps it's because, in many ways, the orchestra is one of the last pure temples of musical worship in existence. In a world where being employed full-time solely to play and perform music is an absolute rarity, the orchestra harkens back to an older time, when patrons of the arts would support musicians out of nothing more than a deep appreciation for their craft. As such, an orchestra member's job requires only learning, rehearsing, and performing the orchestra's repertoire with skill and passion.
 
 There are opportunities for orchestral musicians all over the world, with a particularly large concentration in Europe.
 There are four large groups of instruments in an orchestra: strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion. Each of these groups is broken into a number of subgroups, also called sections, based on instrument; for example, the orchestra's many strings players are grouped into two violin sections, a viola section, a cello section, and a double bass section. Each section is in turn led by a principal player, also called a section leader or first chair, who is tasked with playing orchestral solos, signaling entrances and exits, and determining technical details like bowing or breathing. Orchestra members are charged with listening closely and working together to find cohesion and balance within the larger group a task in which they are led by their conductor and music director, the orchestra's concertmaster, and the section leaders.
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Most orchestra musicians start their professional careers soon after earning a bachelor's or master's degree, usually from a conservatory music performance program. Many begin by working in community and regional orchestras, honing their craft before auditioning for more prestigious orchestras in larger cities, where paychecks and the average level of playing are higher. Auditions are a major part of every orchestra musician's early career.
 
 Once employed by an orchestra, musicians can advance within their instrumental section, climbing to become the principal player, also known as the section leader; the section leader of the first violins is a special position called the concertmaster. Section leaders often stay in their positions for decades, meaning opportunities to take these seats tend to be rare. In addition to playing for better and better orchestras, skilled orchestra musicians can go on to become conductors or music directors, pursue a career as a soloist, start their own music ensembles as bandleaders, or become involved with education or public outreach as nonprofit artists, music teachers, or professors.
 
 Finding Work
 For an orchestra musician just starting out, auditions are the only real way to secure a position with an orchestra. That's why the best method for finding work is to audition wherever possible, without worrying too much about which orchestras might be above or below one's level. Although auditions are universal, every orchestra has its own process for finding new members, and it greatly behooves an aspiring orchestra musician to learn these conventions.
 
 Making the most of the audition process means keeping an eye on union resources like the American Federation of Musicians website(Opens in a new window), taking advantage of networking opportunities, picking the brains of former teachers who may have connections with specific orchestras, and independently keeping track of which orchestras are holding open auditions and when. It's important for musicians in the thick of this process to avoid getting discouraged or unconsciously limiting themselves to a small group of orchestras. There are opportunities for orchestral musicians all over the world.

On a personal level, being collaborative, accommodating, and friendly can help orchestra members thrive in the tight-knit work environment that is an orchestra. Needless to say, the most important quality for an orchestra musician is to be a team player both figuratively and literally.
 
 Work Life
 Orchestra members spend an average of 20 hours per week performing and rehearsing, time that is broken into approximately eight ""services"", a catchall term that encompasses both rehearsals and concerts. They tend to work in the morning or at night, including on weekends and often major holidays. The average orchestra season is 40 weeks long, leaving plenty of time usually in the summer for orchestra musicians to go on vacation, spend time with their families, and develop their craft. Most members of prominent orchestras go on tour at some point in their career, which means some time away from home.",https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/orchestra-member
Orchestrator (Concert and Stage),51121,"Composition, Scoring, and Songwriting","orchestrator (concert and stage), expressive, visionary, instruments, performance, stage","What does an Orchestrator (Concert and Stage) do?
 People outside the music industry often confuse orchestrators with arrangers, and for good reason: each picks up a piece of music where the composer left off. The key difference is that whereas the arranger's job is to reinvent an existing piece of music, the orchestrator's job is to develop, enhance, or complete it while adhering as closely as possible to the composer's creative vision. Depending on how much information the composer passes along, this could mean anything from assigning instrumentation and dynamics to writing entirely new chords and harmonies.
 Orchestrators interact regularly with arrangers and composers and network like crazy in order to land the next gig, so the ability to communicate and get along well with others is vital.
 Some composers create a detailed sketch, called a short score, that clearly indicates their instrument preferences as well as rhythmic and harmonic choices. In these circumstances, an orchestrator's task is to expand the sketch into a full orchestral score by determining the number of players in each section and the registers in which they play, and to balance these dynamics so as to achieve the composer's desired effect.
 Other composers, however, provide only a written melody as a starting point, and in these situations the orchestrator takes on a more collaborative role: conceiving harmonies, chords, rhythms, and tempos for the composition, much like an arranger does, as well as assigning the instrument parts. This is especially common in the film and television industries, where a large number of specialized film and TV orchestrators make a living.
 Orchestrators may also be asked to transpose a score for a different instrument, or change it from soprano to alto or bass to baritone to better suit a vocalist's range.

 Many orchestrators begin as assistants before being hired as lead orchestrators. While film orchestration is a full-time career, concert and stage orchestrators are likely to also work and create as arrangers, copyists, proofreaders, conductors, composers, music directors, bandleaders, or orchestra musicians.
 Successful orchestrators have the opportunity to take part in more prestigious projects, to form creative relationships with established composers, or even to find something resembling full-time employment-a rarity in this business-as the primary orchestrator for a television show, opera company, theater company, or symphony orchestra.
 Finding Work
 Concert and stage orchestrators are usually freelance, and can be hired by composers, producers, bandleaders, music directors, film and television studios, symphony orchestras, opera companies, and theater companies.

It's true that working alone in this way requires focus, discipline, and time management skills. However, it might surprise some to learn that teamwork, communication, and artistic rapport are three of the most important ingredients for success as an orchestrator.
 When a composer works with an orchestrator, he or she needs to be able to trust that the orchestrator will listen closely to the composer's intentions, implement them effectively, and make intelligent artistic choices where the orchestrator is given creative freedom. For a ""solitary"" job, this role is all about understanding and working well with others.
 Work Life
 Freelance orchestrators set their own schedules but must always answer to project deadlines, which are often pressing. Most work out of home offices or studios. A small number of orchestrators are employed by music production houses, in which case they may have a physical office space and official hours.

 Film and TV Orchestrators
 Although orchestration is a useful skill for any composer, composer's assistant, arranger, or bandleader, in the film and TV industries it stands as its own career path. Film and TV orchestrators face unique challenges arising from the conventions of these industries, and must develop a distinct skill set in response.
 Although traditional music notation is still the primary language used by instrumental performers, film and TV composers have come to prefer the ease of MIDI notation. An orchestrator typically receives two things from a composer: a MIDI score and a synthesizer recording that demonstrates how it's meant to sound. Using these two resources-along with advanced listening, transcription, and problem-solving skills-the orchestrator must figure out exactly what the composer is going for musically, and how best to achieve this with the language of music notation. Like any translation, it's far from an exact science, especially when some sections may be too difficult for human players, or contain distorted and heavily modified sounds.
 Additionally, orchestrators usually participate in recording sessions for the scores they orchestrate, performing vital roles such as session conductor or score reader-following along with the score to ensure that the performance is accurate. They may also make last-minute changes to the score in response to feedback from the director or composer, or help the composer operate electronic elements of the score. They don ´t handle printing and passing out the scores; that task usually falls to a music librarian or copyist.
 MIDI Orchestrators
 MIDI orchestrators-whose only real connection to traditional orchestrators is the name they both share-specialize in using the latest synthesized sounds and sample libraries to create high-quality renditions of the score for composers and directors. These techniques are particularly useful for TV composers, whose lower budget prevents them from recording every instrument live. This is a rapidly growing field, as film and TV directors increasingly want to hear the cues exactly as they will sound when recorded in a studio.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Most film orchestrators find their feet in the industry by working film or TV sessions as an orchestral musician or copyist, or by becoming an assistant to an established composer or orchestrator. Becoming well-known as an orchestrator affords the opportunity to expand one's orchestration studio and team. Some orchestrators might switch careers to become composers, conductors, music directors, or performing musicians.
 Finding Work
 Working as assistant to another film and television orchestrator or composer is the best possible way to develop the initial industry contacts, skills, and experience required to find work as an independent orchestrator.

 Interpersonal Skills
 Although the work of orchestration is often solitary in practice, the primary skill for any orchestrator is collaboration. Composers entrust orchestrators with their creative work, which also happens to be their professional product. A good orchestrator needs to know exactly what a composer is trying to accomplish with each note, and facilitate that in the final score-even if the two don ´t exchange a single word. At the same time, orchestrators must consider the musicians who will end up playing the music, and what would make their jobs easier.
 Work Life
 Most orchestrators work freelance out of a home office or private studio. Established orchestrators are likely to have their own teams who assist with the orchestration process. Even if all work up to that point has been remote-and it frequently is-all orchestrators are expected to travel to and participate in recording sessions.

Performing Songwriter,51122,Musicians and Singers,"performing songwriter, independent, project, writer, lyricist, performance, travel","What does a Performing Songwriter do?
 There are more ways than ever to be a songwriter today. Top-line songwriters specialize in writing the words, melodies, and harmonies for Top 40-aiming tracks, while songwriter-producers use synthesizers and sample libraries to create fully formed compositions without ever leaving their houses.
 And then there are performing songwriters. For these artists, who write, record, and perform their own original songs, songwriting is first and foremost a form of expression-a reflection of their unique identity as performers and an extension of their holistic vision. Set apart by qualities such as a particular point of view, vocal sound, use of genre, or way of putting rhymes together, performing songwriters tend to have a more distinctive sound than artists who perform songs by other writers.
 The category of performing songwriters is broad and includes solo artists who primarily release and perform under their own names, such as BjÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€°Ã‚Â¬Ã¢Ë†â€šrk, David Bowie, and Stevie Wonder; songwriters who primarily write and perform with their bands, like the Kinks' Ray Davies, Robbie Robertson of the Band, and the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson; and-of course-a number of songwriting duos who write, record, and perform together.
 Performing songwriters are usually contrasted with staff writers, whose compositions are primarily released and recorded by other artists. In truth, the line between artists and writers is porous, as many staff writers and topliners release and perform their own music, and most performing songwriters provide compositions for other artists at some point in their careers.

 Career Path
 Almost every performing songwriter starts small, writing songs and performing them wherever they can: in music venues, yes, but also cafes, parks, house parties, and community events. Some develop their songwriting talents as members or leaders of a band, while others work within a singer-songwriter tradition, or hire backing musicians to support their compositions. However they choose to work, performing songwriters share a difficult, twofold task: to continuously write, record, and perform as artists while also using outreach to grow the audience for their music.
 Signing to a record label is often seen as a milestone for performing songwriters because it allows them to focus on the musical aspects of the job; the label will often take care of booking, promotion, marketing, merchandising, and more. However, many performing songwriters prefer to maintain their creative independence and instead continue to pursue careers as ""indie""-short for ""independent""-artists. This may mean releasing and promoting their own records, touring to support them, and using unconventional methods like crowdfunding in order to raise enough money to make music on their own terms.
 Some performing songwriters continue writing, releasing, and performing music until their dying day. Others transition-gradually or abruptly-into other aspects of the business: founding and managing their own record label, working in A&R, staff writing for other artists, or teaching songwriting to the next generation.
 Finding Work
 Songwriters need plenty of luck, a willingness to self-promote, terrific networking skills, and talent as performers in order to make it. Aspiring artists should attempt to develop a fan base via social media, local gigs, YouTube videos, and smart branding. Beginning songwriters should seek out local opportunities for collaboration and cross-promotion (e.g. local films, plays, community events). In order to pay the bills, performing songwriters who are early in their careers might utilize music industry connections to work as touring musicians, session musicians, backup singers, or staff writers. Compared with the ongoing and often unprofitable task of writing, recording, releasing, touring, and popularizing their own compositions, gigs like these provide performing songwriters with immediate income.

 Interpersonal Skills
 Writing songs is the way to become a better songwriter, but developing interpersonal skills is the way to become a more successful one. Aspiring songwriters should seek to strengthen their networking, self-promotion, and entrepreneurial skills-abilities that will help them connect with new audiences and take advantage of whatever opportunities come along. To ensure a long career, performing songwriters must also practice critiquing and revising their own work, and foster an open and curious approach to new musical influences and trends.
 Work Life
 Performing songwriters work in a cycle: writing new songs, recording them, releasing them, and touring to support and sell them. Depending on where they are in the production cycle and their own careers, performing songwriters might be working mostly on their own, or collaborating with managers, bandmates, engineers, producers, touring and session musicians, and others. Sometimes the work schedule of a performing songwriter is flexible, allowing time to sleep in and grab coffee before sitting down to finish or revise a song. At other times-like the weeks performing songwriters spend on the road promoting their albums, or the sleepless three-day studio sessions-the schedule is incredibly tight and demanding. Performing songwriters generally enjoy breaks in between albums, when they can reunite with their families and loved ones and spend some time gathering new material before they return to the studio and the road.

Pit Orchestra Musician,51122,Musicians and Singers,"pit orchestra musician, player, member, strings, live, performance, association","? The pit orchestra takes its name from the lowered area in front of a stage the orchestra pit where the musicians and conductor are situated during a theatrical performance. Reading from a score, pit orchestra musicians play their parts with expert precision in order to accompany the onstage actors, dancers, and singers. If done well, the end result is a collaborative performance that's more than the sum of its parts.
 
 Some pursue this job as a long-term career, while others treat it as another freelance music gig, combining it with touring, general business, or session work.
 
 While playing in a pit orchestra is in many ways similar to playing in a full-sized orchestra both require music reading skills, the ability to synchronize with a group, and near-flawless playing there are a number of differences between these two jobs. For one thing, due to budget and size concerns which are exacerbated in touring productions pit orchestra musicians are often asked to play multiple instruments. A reed player may be expected to double on clarinet, flute, and saxophone, for example, or a guitarist to handle ukulele, banjo, and mandolin duties on top of acoustic and electric guitars. For another, rehearsal time tends to be quite limited for pit orchestras and practice sessions are often largely devoted to coordination and synchronization with the performers. Depending on the style of the show and score, a pit orchestra could take any form, from a rock band or symphony orchestra to a single pianist.
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Most pit orchestra musicians are consistent, high-level performers trained in conservatory and university music programs. Some pursue this job as a long-term career, while others treat it as a freelance music gig, combining it with touring, general business, or session work. Experienced and successful pit orchestra musicians might go on to become musical theater music directors, fill out a television band, or join the ranks of an orchestra. Rarely, an extremely well-connected musician can also become a music contractor, placing other musicians in pit and session orchestras.
 
 Finding Work
 Finding work in a pit orchestra is almost exclusively a function of networking and referrals. Competition is fierce, especially in New York, where long-term jobs abound and the local musiciansÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ­ union stipulates that a player is required to be in the pit for only fifty percent of a showÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ­s scheduled performances each year provided they find their own substitutes. Subbing in is a common way for aspiring pit orchestra musicians to get their first experience on a big show.

 Interpersonal Skills
 Pit orchestra musicians are not soloists. While they may perform an involved or public-facing role in certain theatrical performances, their chief job is to expertly accompany without drawing attention away from the dramatic, narrative, or visual action. This job requires humility, focus, flexibility, the ability to synchronize with and accompany actors and dancers, and the stamina and temperament to play the same music eight or nine times per week. Additionally, pit orchestra musicians are expected to master their parts on their own time, a task which requires time management and organizational skills.
 
 Work Life
 Working as a pit musician offers a rare mix of security and freedom, thanks to a steady paycheck and the luxury of free time: a dayÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ­s work might only be two or so hours long. As such, it's an excellent night job for any performing musician pursuing related goals, such as joining an orchestra or television band.
 
 Players who have been hired for a touring show, however, will spend long stretches on the road. A yearlong national tour might stop for six weeks in one city before moving on to the next, which could be either a wonderful opportunity to travel and see the world or a disruptive liability, depending on one's circumstances.",https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/pit-musician
Playwright,51120,"Acting, Theatre & Dance","playwright, script, play writer, play, theater, festival, language, ","What does a Playwright do?
 If you break the word ""playwright"" down into two parts, you already have a great understanding of what playwrights do: they write the scripts for plays, which then go on to be staged in theatrical productions. The play is a unique writing form, consisting of two principal elements: dialogue and stage directions. Using only these two elements, along with a brief character list and introduction to the play's setting, playwrights weave complex dramatic narratives that are intended to truly blossom in live performance.
 Even more so than other forms of writing, playwriting fundamentally requires the ability to observe: to pay attention to and capture the essence of characters, relationships, settings, styles of speech, and more.
 For most playwrights, getting one's plays produced, or staged, is a large part of the job-after all, it's the main way that playwrights get paid for their work. Once they've completed a play, a playwright might start by submitting it to theater companies, production companies, producers, or directors, hoping that it strikes someone's interest. A play might be sold for a fee or, more likely, leased for a small fee in addition to the promise of future royalties. In some cases, especially first stagings, the playwright might participate in the rehearsal process, advising the cast and crew as (or in addition to) a dramaturg and making small rewrites based on feedback from the actors and director. In other cases, the playwright's role ends as soon as he or she turns the script over to the producer or company.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Playwrighting doesn't require a specific degree, but being good at it certainly requires prior experience in and appreciation for theater, which is why playwrights often have degrees in theater. A playwright's level of success can generally be measured by where their work gets produced. At the beginning of their careers, playwrights usually get started writing plays for their own pleasure-many of which go unstaged-and gradually progress to writing plays that are produced by local or regional theater companies. Eventually, skilled and successful playwrights' work may be produced on bigger and bigger stages, winding up in prestigious locations like New York City's Broadway. Playwrights might also write for opera, in which case they're called librettists, or collaborate with composers to create original or adapted musical theater shows.
 Finding Work
 Most playwrights don't have employers in a traditional sense, or at least not for their playwriting; they produce work independently and based on their own desires. However, they can be-and often are-commissioned by theater companies, festivals, and musical theater adapters to write a single script, usually on a specific topic or theme. They can also be employed by colleges and universities as teaching artists, temporarily engaged by theater companies or other arts nonprofits in programs called residencies, or work in some other capacity-for example as a director, dramaturg, or actor. In order to get their plays staged, networking with producers, directors, and artistic directors is essential.

 Interpersonal Skills
 Playwriting is about storytelling-creating a world and characters from scratch and capturing listeners with their story-but it's also about live performance; in fact, it's this critical element that separates playwrights from novelists or screenwriters. Understanding what goes into a compelling live performance is vital for playwrights, as well as having a strong sense of the capabilities of theater and the visual imagination to envision a performance before it occurs. Additionally, even more so than other forms of writing, playwriting fundamentally requires the ability to observe: to pay attention to and capture the essence of characters, relationships, settings, styles of speech, and more.
 Work Life
 The work life for a playwright has everything to do with their employment situation, as well as what stage of their career they're in. A moderately successful playwright might teach playwriting at a college while developing new work on the side. On the other hand, a beginning playwright is likely to have a day job in the theater world (or elsewhere) competing for their time, while the most successful playwrights have free rein over their schedules, but might be kept busy with commissions and deadlines.

Private Music Instructor,51122,Music Education,"private music instructor, specialized, one on one, individual, private, independent","? Private music instructors, who usually specialize in an instrument or class of instruments, work one-on-one with students to develop their instrumental technique, performance ability, and advanced skills such as notation, theory, improvisation, and auditioning. Many private music instructors are self-employed, and as such have great control over every aspect of their work, from the age range and skill level of their students to the musical styles and pedagogical methods employed. 
 
 An instructor who teaches beginners will typically develop their basic skills scales and chords, proper fingerings and posture, etc. and work on rudimentary pieces. On the other hand, instructors of advanced and professional musicians will focus on performance, repertoire, and preparing students for auditions, recitals, concerts, and exams.
 
 Like all teachers, private music instructors spend plenty of time outside of lessons on related work, including maintaining or developing their own musical skills; studying new pedagogical methods; gathering materials relevant to their students' interests and stage of musical development; planning individual lessons; scheduling lessons; and managing the other administrative tasks associated with running a small business, such as marketing and finances.
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 There are no official educational requirements to establish oneself as a private music instructor, although degrees in music performance and education certainly help inspire confidence from potential clients and students. Private music instructors take varying paths in their careers; one might go to graduate school and work as a music professor before opening a private studio at an older age, while another might spend their early life as a professional musician before transitioning to education. Still others work for public schools, or specialize in a particular kind of music education, such as adaptive arts education, early childhood education, or vocal coaching.
 
 Finding Work
 The many private music instructors who are self-employed are responsible for recruiting their own students via advertising, networking, and word of mouth. They might also use techniques like distributing cards and flyers to music and instrument shops and offering discounts for referrals, or form professional partnerships with other teachers and receive students on recommendation. Private music instructors might also work for independent or chain music education companies. With time and experience, successful private instructors can attract talented students, charge more for lessons, and expand their business.

 Successful private music instructors combine seemingly contradictory qualities: they are patient and demanding, impassioned and articulate, and able to simultaneously nurture their students and push them to do the hard work required to advance as an instrumentalist and blossom as a musician. It is important to remember that a terrific player doesn't necessarily make a great teacher. The best instructors are skilled communicators as well as deft instrumentalists, invested in their students' growth, and knowledgeable about pedagogy.
 
 Work Life
 Most private teachers are independent contractors who set their own work schedules, rates, and work location. Most work out of a studio or their own homes, or travel to their students' homes. The workday generally takes the form of many individual lessons, each of which lasts between 30 and 60 minutes.
 
 Private music instructors who work for music education companies have work lives similar to those of freelancers, but may lack the freedom to set their own schedule, rates, and location. In exchange, they're likely to have a more consistent paycheck, and don't have to spend as much time on administrative tasks like scheduling, marketing, and networking.",https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/private-instructor
Product Manager,52119,Music Business & Management,"product manager, organization, marketing, management, manager, promotion","What does a Product Manager do?
 While specific tasks vary by workplace, product managers are broadly responsible for driving and managing all phases of a product's design, development, and launch-shepherding products from an idea to the marketplace. Whether dealing with a physical product like a microphone or an intangible product like audio editing software, product managers are concerned with understanding customer demographics, behavior, and needs; analyzing similar and competitive products in the marketplace; establishing how a product fits into a company's vision and business model; and determining how best to market and sell it.
 Product managers perform a uniquely hybrid role for product-oriented companies, bridging the gap between user experience, design, and marketing. For a product manager working in the tech sector, daily tasks typically include overseeing market research and customer satisfaction, collaborating with stakeholders to update existing products or pitch new ones, defining a new product's requirements, working with digital product designers to test and tweak features, communicating information across departments, and working closely with the marketing department to craft campaigns and launch products.
 Product managers in other industries-such as instrument manufacturing or the record industry-do similarly broad managerial work.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 While educational requirements for working as a product manager vary, the expectation that product managers have prior knowledge and experience in their field does not. Frequently, product managers start as product designers before discovering that their real passion is in conceiving of products, ensuring that their design answers user needs, and marketing them as they're released.
 Others start as marketing representatives before acquiring basic design skills. It's common to work as an assistant product manager first before being allowed to take the reins. Product managers who do particularly well can become senior product managers, who tend to take a broader overview of all the company's products rather than focusing on development. From there, it's possible to move into the executive ranks.
 Product managers may also work as or become UX designers.
 Finding Work
 Product managers work for a wide variety of employers, including tech companies, app developers, game developers, music software companies, music gear and equipment manufacturers, instrument manufacturers, and music streaming services, to name a few. Opportunities abound in this booming field, although familiarity with the product is vital to landing a job-as is building a network of connections in one's field of choice.

 Also vital is the confidence and charisma to lead teams, direct complicated work flow, and efficiently manage numerous projects at once. The ideal product manager has a strong interest in customer experience, product design, and marketing-and excels at connecting the three to create bold, effective, and successful products.
 Work Life
 Product management is a fast-paced, intense job. Days are filled with meetings, phone calls and emails, strategizing sessions, customer and data analysis, and more. Depending entirely on the product manager's field, the hours could be regular or inconsistent, and the setting could be anything from an office to a workshop.

Program Director (Performing Arts Education),40030,Music Education,"program director (performing arts education), vision, organization, management, director, leader","What does a Program Director (Performing Arts Education) do?
 There are hundreds of decisions that go into shaping the character of any performing arts education program. Which genres and pieces will students learn to perform? What kinds of instruction will be offered? How much time will students spend in the classroom and how much out of it? And, perhaps most importantly, what will students gain, both in terms of skills and resources, by the time they graduate from the program? Program directors help educational institutions to answer these questions while designing and implementing a unified educational approach based on the institute's principles-as well as their own.
 This is a senior position that requires many years of teaching experience in the arts.
 Whether their student body consists mostly of primary school beginners, conservatory-level young adults, or people of a wide range of ages and experience levels, program directors are constantly working to make their educational programs the best they can be. This generally means overseeing course offerings, guiding the creation of curricula, hiring and evaluating teachers, allocating the department's budget, and seeking out and negotiating exciting performance, collaboration, and employment opportunities for students and graduates. If they have time, program directors try to stay in contact with the needs of the student body and might even teach classes or private students themselves.

 Career Path
 Program directors are senior arts educators who have backgrounds as performers and artists, as well as experience in management and administration. Most program directors start out as teaching artists. They may also work as university professors, higher-education administrators, or nonprofit artists. While many program directors are hired to lead already existing educational programs, some found and helm their own educational institutes or nonprofits. Success as a program director might come by securing increased funding, allowing the purchase of new materials or the expansion of the program to new areas.
 Finding Work
 Program directors typically work for private schools, public schools, larger public school districts, community arts programs, or private arts education institutes. Those who work for individual public or private schools might be called department heads, while those who oversee public school districts are called district supervisors and are generally promoted from among the district's best music, dance, or drama teachers. Jobs that aren't filled internally are generally posted on conventional job listing websites and through arts education listservs and professional organizations.

 Good program directors have a wealth of teaching and performing experience to draw on when establishing a curriculum and evaluating teaching staff; they understand teachers' challenges and concerns and look for ways to make their work easier while also holding them to an exacting standard. Program directors must also be detail-oriented and flexible, meticulously maintaining and fine-tuning their programs while keeping an eye out for opportunities to grow.
 Work Life
 Program directors do most of their work within normal business hours in an office setting, but that doesn't mean their schedule is rigid. The office work may be broken up by classroom visits, meetings, and work-related trips. For example, program directors in public school districts (usually called district supervisors) frequently travel from school to school to check on classroom implementation of their curricular policies. Similarly, program directors of higher-level performance programs (e.g., a conservatory program with an emphasis on world music) often travel to establish new performance and cultural exchange opportunities.

Program Director (Radio),52119,Music Business & Management,"program director (radio), vision, head, style, genres, director","What does a Program Director (Radio) do?
 If there's one person who could claim to be responsible for an entire radio station, it's the program director. While upper management is chiefly concerned with the station as a business, program directors work on the ground floor to create the radio station as it is perceived by audiences: the content, tone, and unifying direction that give the station a unique identity. To accomplish this, program directors hire and groom many of the radio hosts and personalities; work with writers to come up with ideas for new shows; screen the content and direction of each segment; collaborate with the music director to create the station's playlist; keep track of music logs; dictate the station's schedule; and employ extensive market research to ensure that shows are doing well in their time slots. When it comes to the station's content, program directors are involved with almost everything.
 Most program directors are dedicated to and inspired by the process of shaping a radio station to fulfill their vision, but this creative impulse must always be balanced with good business sense.
 Overseeing content creation, curation, and scheduling-in other words, the programming-is the primary duty of the program director. However, what ultimately makes the program director's job so challenging is being responsible to so many different parties: the upper management, who want a profitable business; the disc jockeys and music directors, who want to fulfill their own creative and professional objectives; and the listeners, who may have their own completely distinct relationships with, and expectations of, the station. In other words, program directors have to consider ratings and viewership, work to cultivate a consistent audience, and pursue their own vision of the station's values, aesthetic, politics, or brand-all while attempting to create a finished product that appears harmonious.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 One of the most advanced positions at any radio station, working as a program director usually requires a minimum of 10 years of prior experience in radio. During those years, program directors-also called PDs-may work as hosts, reporters, broadcast engineers, field recordists, or music directors. They also become comfortable with a wide range of radio formats including music, news, weather, sports, and other varieties of talk radio.
 As for many top-level positions, advancing in this role typically means finding a larger station to helm. Program directors might also make the leap to internet radio or music streaming. Today, popular streaming services are scrambling to recruit former program and music directors to unify and guide their playlists and offerings.
 Finding Work
 Significant experience working in broadcasting is essential. To get started, one should look for internships at a local station or contribute to a college station. Whether it's working in front of the mic as a DJ or radio host or behind the scenes as a broadcast engineer or other audio tech, what's important is understanding the breadth of the station's day-to-day operations and developing versatility as an employee.

Everything's a balancing act for program directors, which requires a particular mix of diplomacy, critical thinking, and leadership.
 Work Life
 Program directors generally work long, strange hours. They might arrive earlier than other employees to make adjustments to the playlist or check out the newest ratings reports, and then stay late to ensure that everything is prepared for the night and following day. Many jobs are described as ""full-time,"" but this one really means it; even the program director ´s days off-which may be few and far between-are not safe from last-minute changes to the schedule, technical problems, or other practical complications. The position usually doesn't require much travel other than the commute between the station and home, which may be done multiple times each day.

 Project managers are responsible for mapping out the scope and life of a project, from concept to completion.

 Project managers are multitaskers who think one step ahead of potential problems. They must be effective and tactful communicators, as part of the job is communicating information to colleagues and motivating them to stay on track. Most importantly, project managers are deeply organized. Generally speaking, project managers are the sort of people who love making spreadsheets-color-coded, of course-and whose lists have lists. They're also results-oriented, and will do what it takes to keep a project on track. This trait is particularly invaluable in fast-paced tech environments, where project delays can reduce the value and longevity of a product or even render it obsolete.
 Work Life
 Project managers typically work normal business hours in an office setting, but when projects fall behind-as they inevitably do-project managers are usually expected to put in extra hours to brainstorm ways to get them back on track. Those who run a tight ship might be able to avoid overtime or working from home. However, due to the nature of their job, the best project managers tend to be the kind of people who go above and beyond for their projects, and as such are likely to bring work home on a consistent basis.

Promotion Manager,52119,Music Business & Management,"promotion manager, product, marketing, management, ","What does a Promotion Manager do?
 Due to the name, record promotion is often confused with publicity and marketing. However, the difference is clearer than it sounds: while the publicity department takes care of television appearances and magazine articles, and the marketing department develops artists ´ long-term brand and social media presence, it ´s up to the promotion department-and the promotion manager as one of its senior staff-to pitch new tracks, records, and artists to radio stations across the country, securing radio airplay and growing the audience for the label's releases.
 To do so, promotion managers cultivate a broad network of connections with music directors (MDs) and program directors (PDs) at key radio stations across their territory, which may consist of a small geographical region or a cluster of high-profile national stations. Promotion managers might also analyze record performance data in order to develop regional and national promotion strategies, as well as supervise field representatives and other entry-level members of the promotions department.
 This is a job that requires excellent communication skills, the ability to speak persuasively about music, a strong knowledge of and appreciation for radio as a medium, and persistence.
 Besides the numbers game of getting as many records as possible into radio circulation and onto the charts-which is ongoing-promotion managers also handle a number of more occasional promotional duties. When the label's touring artists come through the region, it's often promotion managers who develop and coordinate promotional events such as meet-and-greets, merchandise and album giveaways, and radio visits, performances, and interviews.
 And as the most up-to-date source of information on how records and artists are performing on the charts, promotion managers frequently collaborate with the other label departments to ensure that all aspects of marketing strategy are moving in tandem. Sometimes promotion managers are made responsible for increasing airplay on music video channels and internet radio. All in all, this is a job that requires excellent communication skills, the ability to speak persuasively about music, a strong knowledge of-and appreciation for-radio as a medium, and persistence.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Many promotion managers start as field representatives, working a small region of radio stations and other music-related businesses. Others begin in radio, working at local stations, before switching over to work for record label promotion departments. An experienced promotion manager might become the director of promotions at the label, overseeing a team of managers and staffers, or transition into working as an independent radio promoter, which is a freelance position that utilizes the same contacts and knowledge-base but allows for more freedom in selecting clients.
 Finding Work
 An internship in a label ´s promotion department is an excellent jumping off point for an aspiring promotion manager, and frequently leads to an entry-level position in the department. However, one should be aware that these internships are rarely paid anymore.
 Working in music radio can be an alternate path to radio promotion, as doing so helps one to develop an understanding of what radio stations look for in the songs they pick up, knowledge of different radio formats, and an initial network of contacts.

 Communication is the most important skill for a promotion manager, whether it ´s getting and relaying reports, giving directions to field representatives in the promotion manager ´s territory, convincing a program director at a radio station to take a new track from an unseasoned artist, collaborating with the marketing or publicity departments on a promotional push for a label artist, or discussing the label ´s priorities and overall strategies with a promotion VP or format head. Promotion managers must be persuasive salespeople when they ´re working on their own, intelligent analysts when planning broad promotional strategies, and wise delegators when distributing tasks to their staff. An excellent memory, a pleasant and personable demeanor, and a love of music and radio are also helpful.
 Work Life
 This is a field that is competitive by definition: every day, dozens of people in similar roles at different labels are competing for a limited number of spots on the same radio station playlists. As a result, most promotion managers work long hours, sometimes rising early to assess charts and Nielsen BDS reports.
 Some managers fulfill an almost entirely supervisory role, in which case the bulk of the work is remote or office-oriented: conducting meetings and calls with radio stations, advising and supervising field staff, and communicating with other departments and higher-ups via reports, email, meetings, and conference calls. Other promotion managers, especially those employed by smaller labels, travel to and from radio stations to maintain valuable business relationships and to find circulation for songs.

Proofreader,51121,"Composition, Scoring, and Songwriting","proofreader, editor, details, meticulous, language, ","What does a Proofreader do?
 Music proofreaders perform a valuable role for composers and musicians, saving their precious rehearsal and recording time by ensuring that the written music and lyrics are accurate and free of errors. Like general text proofreaders, music proofreaders mainly correct typographical and spelling errors, as well as ensure that everything comes across as intended on the page. However, they might also take a closer look at issues specific to music-such as pitch, rhythm, bar numbers, dynamics, articulation, page turns, fingerings, bowings, aesthetics, house style, and positioning-in order to prepare a piece for publication. In this way, their job is similar to that of a copyist, who also proofreads and prepares sheet music.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 While there are no formal educational requirements to work as a music proofreader, a deep knowledge of music notation and an understanding of a variety of instruments are both essential-and when it comes to getting a job in this field, a degree can only help.
 Like copyists and transcribers, most proofreaders don't make a full living off this work and don't intend to pursue it as a long-term career. Instead, they are aspiring composers, conductors, orchestrators, arrangers, and music directors. For many of them, this job not only provides a steady source of income but also allows the opportunity to make valuable connections within their field.
 Finding Work
 Many proofreaders get their start by apprenticing under a music prep person of some variety (usually a copyist, proofreader, arranger, or orchestrator), although some develop the necessary skills by working as composer's assistants. While some proofreaders are freelancers, many work full or part-time in the music publishing industry, editing and proofreading new releases.

 Music proofreading is all about organization, attention to detail, and focus. Given how many aspects of sheet music there are to examine, it ´s important for proofreaders to have an organized method to their work to prevent them from missing potential problems. For freelancers, time management is also key.
 Work Life
 Freelance proofreaders manage their own time, taking care of jobs as they come in and likely combining their proofreading work with other ventures. Proofreaders who work for publishing companies are likely to enjoy more consistent hours and work out of an office.

Publicist,52119,Music Business & Management,"publicist, public, media, social, image creation, demographic","What does a Publicist do?
 Whether they work in-house at a record label, for an independent public relations company, or as a freelancer, publicists have two main goals in mind: to solicit attention for a client, product, or brand from the media, tastemakers, and customers; and to handle the situation when that attention becomes too negative.
 Creating Media Campaigns
 In order to spark interest in their clients, publicists create large-scale media campaigns; if the client is a musical artist or band, these typically precede the release of a new album or tour.
 In the first phase of a publicity campaign, the publicist may arrange for promotional photos, write a bio (or hire a freelance writer to do so), update websites and social media pages, and brainstorm pitches. When these pieces are in place, the publicist sends the press kit to the media-including streaming links or advance copies of the new music-and launches the second phase of the campaign. Corresponding over phone and email with interested parties, the publicist may schedule interviews, book on-air appearances, and line up feature stories and reviews for their client. When the client isn't well-established or is lacking in momentum, the publicist must rely on reputation, hard-won industry connections, and persuasion to secure these opportunities.
 Handling PR Crises
 Of course, not all media attention is positive; when a rock star behaves badly at a club, makes controversial remarks in an interview, or receives concentrated bad press for any other reason, it's the publicist's job to run damage control. This can include giving a spoken or written statement in response to the situation, advising the client on how to handle the situation day-by-day, or even crafting a strategy to turn scandal into opportunity.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Publicists work for record labels, public-relations firms, and entertainment companies. They may also be freelance. Junior publicists at record labels and PR firms can advance to become senior publicists, and eventually publicity directors.
 Some publicists-called tour publicists- specialize in promoting and increasing audiences for tours. Others, called public-relations counselors, work alongside artists to craft overall brand strategies.
 Finding Work
 Internships are the way to go when trying to break into the world of publicity, and many public-relations companies offer development programs for students and recent graduates. Aspiring publicists can also contact local unsigned bands and volunteer to write their media releases as a way of building a portfolio.

 Interpersonal Skills
 Publicists must be able to cultivate and maintain relationships with many industry and media contacts; in other words, this is a job for a networker. Publicists must also be cool under pressure, organized, and available to work at all hours. If a client cancels on a talk show or booked PR appearance, the show's talent buyer needs to be able to reach the publicist right away-not the publicist's voicemail.
 Work Life
 Publicists spend the vast majority of their time corresponding with clients, TV producers, and journalists through phone and email. Although they're likely to have an office, they do just as much work on the go-traveling to meetings and events-as they do behind a desk. Publicists have to be available 24/7 in order to connect with and advise clients, respond to last-minute scheduling changes, and handle crises when they occur.

Radio DJ,52114,Motion Pictures & Broadcasting,"radio dj, remix, studio, on-air, personality, voice","? Once upon a time, radio DJs were influential tastemakers in the music industry who chose all of the music for their own shows and could break an act into the mainstream with a few spins of the turntable. Today, however, most commercial radio stations use music playlists, which are selected by the music director or program director and tend to be heavily based on market research rather than personal taste.
 
 As a result, the role of the commercial DJ has shifted away from music curation and toward hosting themed segments of storytelling, music discussion, current events, journalism, and more. The exception is college and independent radio DJs, who are likely to curate all of the music in their segments.
 
 Because the work is broadcast live, terrestrial radio DJs need to be able to think on their toes, remain calm under pressure, and multitask.
 
 In broadcast radio, a typical workday often begins a couple of hours before going on the air with show preparation at the station: checking the charts, news, and social media to see what's trending; recording commercials and on-air promotions; and scheduling music and talking points. Shift lengths vary, but DJs are often on air for three to five hours, during which time songs are interspersed with weather reports, listener requests, contests, on-air promotions for concerts and events, and radio banter. More production work often takes place after the shift ends. Satellite and internet radio DJs, without a local audience to engage, focus almost exclusively on music and talk.
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 There are no specific educational requirements to become a radio DJ, although a station might look for a DJ with a particular degree in order to round out their roster. Most DJs start off volunteering at a college or independent radio station before landing a paid job at a commercial one. In this career, success can mean shifting from part-time to full-time, changing from a late-night shift to the more popular drive-time shift, or eventually becoming a music director or program director. Some radio DJs go on to fame and fortune as on-air personalities, while others transition into careers in television.
 
 Finding Work
 Radio DJs are employed by broadcast, satellite, and internet radio stations. Aspiring radio DJs can get their first credits and exposure to the industry by volunteering at a college or independent radio station, interning at a major radio station, or producing and distributing their own podcast.

 Interpersonal Skills
 DJs are known for their rich, spellbinding voices and charismatic personalities. Certainly, being outgoing, quick-witted, and talkative is key for a DJ, and a good sense of humor also goes a long way. However, because the work is broadcast live, it's perhaps even more important that terrestrial radio DJs are able to think on their toes, remain calm under pressure, and do two or three things at once. Whether it's new information coming in during a segment or something going catastrophically wrong in the studio, DJs must keep their cool, maintain their on-air personality, and continue talking.
 
 Work Life
 Terrestrial radio DJs organize their workdays and their lives around their shift times. For example, DJs working the morning drive time must wake quite early and are already finished up by the early afternoon, while DJs holding down the overnight shift will need to become partially nocturnal. In comparison, satellite and internet DJs have much more flexibility about when (and perhaps even where) they work.

Record Company Executive,52119,Music Business & Management,"record company executive, deals, finance, negotiation","What does a Record Company Executive do?
 Because record companies structure their executive ranks in different ways and job descriptions vary depending on the company's size, mission, and values, it's impossible to neatly summarize a music executive's work. Record company executives perform a wide range of roles within the industry, from star-maker to legal counsel, and wield enormous influence over the marketplace and culture of the music business. Some executives are largely concerned with finances, while others focus on global strategy or artists and repertoire (A&R).
 Aspiring executives should aim to acquire a broad and flexible skill set while rising through the ranks.
 There's a world of difference between executives at large, established companies and those at smaller, independent ones. The CEO at an industry powerhouse such as Sony Music manages and directs all aspects of the company's worldwide operations, while someone with the same title at a new indie label does pretty much everything, from signing artists to answering phones. An executive might oversee any or all aspects of the record business: production, distribution, marketing, radio promotion, digital initiatives, corporate communications, label strategy, and/or artist discovery.
 Whatever their area of expertise, most record company executives participate in frequent meetings, respond to mountains of emails and phone calls, take part in brainstorming sessions with pop-culture-savvy colleagues, and strategize about the future of the label. Being a record company executive requires deep knowledge of both business and music; those who understand one but not the other tend not to last long.

Recording Artist (or Group),51122,Musicians and Singers,"recording artist (or group), studio, radio, product, streaming, recording, producer, producing, collaborate, collaboration, vision, computer","? Almost all of the world's most recognizable and celebrated musicians are recording artists but that doesn't mean all recording artists are successful. The definition of a recording artist is simple: a musical artist or group that records and releases music. It doesn't matter whether they're songwriters who create their own material, pop star singers whose songs are written by teams of staff writers, original bands that create unique or niche music, or DJs who create remixes if they consistently record and release music, they are recording artists.
 
 Once a musician has cultivated a large fan base, scored several hits, and/or signed with a major label, it's possible to quit the day job and focus on recording, releasing, and performing music.
 
 While recording is usually what brings recording artists recognition or even fame, most artists actually spend the bulk of their time performing. Recording an album is a creatively exhausting process, the whole of which from finding or creating initial material to receiving the final mix can take anywhere from a month to six months or more. Some artists release multiple albums per year, while others go several years without stepping into the studio, relying on royalties and touring to make a living. Speaking of touring, recording artists spend almost all their time outside of the studio booking shows or tours to perform their recorded songs live. Touring not only helps promote new albums, but also serves as a reliable source of income in a time when recorded music generates less revenue than ever before.
 
 Perhaps the greatest divide in this field is between artists who are signed to record labels and those who are independent. Landing a deal with a record company provides numerous benefits, chief among them access to the label's financial, promotional, and organizational resources. Labels provide managers, search for and license great songs from publishers, hire producers who help select and edit material, book recording studios, pay for mixing and mastering, and market the release through radio promotion, publicity campaigns, and more. In contrast, independent artists need to generate funds themselves or employ impressive ingenuity to record, mix, market, and release their work.

 Career Path
 Recording and releasing music isn't likely to provide much income in the beginning, which is why most recording artists work additional jobs early in their careers. Working in or around the music industry is ideal, perhaps as a touring musician, session musician, staff writer, top-line songwriter, recording engineer, live sound engineer, or concert tech.
 
 Once a musician has cultivated a large fan base, scored several hits, and/or signed with a major label, it's possible to quit the day job and focus on recording, releasing, and performing music. Successful recording artists might continue recording and playing music until the day they die. Those who choose not to continue as recording artists might use their career to catapult into the record industry as A&R representatives, found their own record label and represent other artists, become a music producer, or teach music as private instructors.
 
 Finding Work
 Once upon a time, the only way to become a recording artist was to sign a contract with a label and head into a commercial studio. Today, however, anyone with a laptop and simple gear can make a record in their bedroom, promote it on social media, and release it independently through sites like Bandcamp or SoundCloud. And indeed, many aspiring recording artists do just that: releasing music independently and playing local shows while working a day job. However, landing a deal with a record company still provides numerous benefits, including potentially the opportunity to quit one's day job and focus on recording, releasing, and performing music something difficult for independent artists to do unless they have a significant nationwide audience or massive royalties.

Charisma, public speaking, and showmanship are all important for giving an exciting live performance, and shrewd business sense and negotiation skills are essential when discussing a recording or licensing contract. Finally, it takes a tremendous amount of dedication and perseverance to continue making music when success seems elusive, as it often does at the start.
 
 Work Life
 The average recording artist likely spends anywhere between a week and several months preparing material before heading into the studio. Recording the album might only take a week or two, but it will be a few more weeks or months before it's been mixed and mastered. Somewhere between when an album is recorded and when it's released, a recording artist will usually begin promoting the album by giving interviews, sending out fan base emails, announcing tours, and more. Then it's time to tour, which usually lasts around two to four months. After that the recording artist might catch his or her breath at home for a few weeks or months before beginning work on a new album, or commencing a second tour in a different region.",https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/recording-group-or-band
Repetiteur,51122,Music Education,"repetiteur, accompanist, coach, technique, rehearsal, performance","What does a Repetiteur do?
 A role that's entirely unique to opera, the repetiteur is one of the driving forces behind the opera rehearsal process. During group rehearsals, these pianists serve as accompanists, skillfully reducing the complicated orchestral scores for piano in a way that preserves the spirit of a live orchestra. Then, when it's time for small group or one-on-one rehearsals, repetiteurs add vocal coaching to their already heavy workload. Working with soloists and chorus members, they correct the singers' pitch, rhythm, musicality, and even pronunciation. This unique combination of teaching and playing in service of one of the most singular art forms around-opera-makes those in the know describe this role as one of the most creatively diverse and fulfilling available for an experienced pianist and teacher.
 Love for musical coaching and deep knowledge of opera repertoire-every voice, every instrument, and every word-are absolutely necessary for this role.
 Despite what the name might suggest, this job is far from repetitive. Repetiteurs not only need to be master pianists capable of sight-reading and reducing scores at the drop of a hat, but must also possess almost encyclopedic knowledge of opera repertoire. As if that weren't enough, they also sometimes take rehearsal notes for conductors, sing choral parts (while playing piano), play other keyboard instruments, operate sound effects, and conduct backstage choirs during performance. Additionally, the job requires repetiteurs to be proficient in a number of languages, the most common of which are Italian, German, French, English, and Russian. All in all, it ´s a varied and nuanced job that requires a diverse skill set, an impressive work ethic, and incredible attention to detail.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Most repetiteurs study some combination of piano performance, voice, and opera in a conservatory setting. They gain experience teaching by coaching individual singers or working with choirs; and they build experience accompanying opera by playing with local, amateur, or youth opera groups. Like the opera performers they coach, repetiteurs can eventually work their way up to jobs with respected opera companies through a combination of persistence, connections, and lucky breaks. On the other hand, some choose to move into related but distinct fields, becoming chorus masters, musical directors, conductors, or independent vocal coaches.
 Finding Work
 Not many musicians have the diversity of skills, thorough knowledge, and flexible disposition necessary to be a repetiteur. As a result, despite the limited number of available positions in the field, it ´s not hard to find work for those who are persistent, assertive, and qualified. Some opera companies have a trainee position, which functions almost as an assistant repetiteur; this can be a good place to start. Youth opera is also a sure bet for gaining experience.

In a setting like this, maintaining concentration and coming in on the right bar every time requires razor-sharp focus. On the teaching side, it's important for repetiteurs to be communicative, supportive, and personable. Finally, love for musical coaching and deep knowledge of opera repertoire-every voice, every instrument, and every word-are absolutely necessary for this role. Love for this work, along with a certain degree of humbleness, is essential for success as a repetiteur.
 Work Life
 Repetiteurs can be freelancers, working with opera companies on a part-time basis, in which case they are usually paid for three-hour sessions. These freelance repetiteurs usually also work as a general accompanist, concert pianist, or conductor. More often, though, repetiteurs are full-time employees who are paid a salary as members of the opera company ´s musical crew. Travel is uncommon but still an expected part of the job; whether freelance or in-house, most repetiteurs will end up going on tour at some point. Being a repetiteur can mean long hours, especially in the final weeks before the show goes up. Staging rehearsals usually take all day, and afterward the repetiteur goes back home-you guessed it-to practice the next day's music.

 As the name suggests, royalty coordinators are concerned with all aspects of royalties and their payment. They track and record incoming royalty payments and statements, review and analyze the data to ensure that no one is underpaying or overpaying, contact sources directly to resolve issues when they arise, and prepare and issue royalty statements to the copyright holders of the song or recording.
 At its heart, this position is a mix of bookkeeping, analysis, and problem-solving. Royalty coordinators spend the majority of their time entering and combing through data, as well as devising new ways to organize and display it. But when they're not, they're working with the real people behind those numbers to ensure that everyone is being fairly compensated-a task that requires a mixture of diplomacy and straightforwardness. This position exists in a variety of industries; where there are copyrights, there are royalty coordinators. In the music business, these royalties are collected for the use of copyrighted compositions or recordings, and are generally owed to publishers, record labels, and artists.

Session Conductor,51121,"Composition, Scoring, and Songwriting","session conductor, conductor, leader, goal oriented, ","What does a Session Conductor do?
 It's a common question: How is conducting in a recording session different from conducting on stage? While stage conducting involves working night after night with a specific orchestra, session conducting is usually a contracted, one-time-only job performed by professional composers, orchestrators, and conductors who work in or around the film, television, and video game industries. For these professionals, session conducting work is a repeatable way to earn money while networking and staying involved with their field.
 Orchestrator and film conductor Pete Anthony says, ""It's very rare for someone to make a living just as a film music conductor; almost all of us have to do different things.""
 In the film industry, everything moves very quickly. Film scores are ready only moments or at best a few days before recording sessions, and are far from being set in stone. As a result, session conductors have to come to sessions ready to work hard and learn fast. At the top of the session, conductors usually take the opportunity to discuss the music with the composer and orchestrator, touching on specific concerns including tempo, sonic balance in the performance, difficult passages, and electronic elements of the score. Then, session conductors assist musicians, who may be seeing the score for the first time, by correcting wrong notes, unpacking difficult parts, and clarifying the intentions of the piece. Occasionally, session conductors must also adjust to last-minute changes to the score, usually due to the director's request.
 ""The conductor is like the director of a play... He takes suggestions and gives directions; but for the most part, he lets the great talents perform without interfering.""
 - Film conductor and music director Mike Nowak
 When it's finally time for the recording, the job of a session conductor is quite similar to that of a stage conductor: to keep the group unified, to make adjustments, and to serve as the emotional center of the performance, shaping the music. Every session is unique, with its own rules, requirements, and challenges. Ultimately, a session conductor ´s job is to help the orchestra play well, aid the recording engineer in getting a clean take, and support the composer and director in achieving their goals for the work.

 Career Path
 The professionals who work as session conductors are usually also composers, orchestrators, arrangers, stage conductors, orchestral musicians, or some combination of the above. Because experience in a film or television recording session is critical for a session conductor, it's rare for seasoned stage conductors to suddenly dive into session conducting without prior experience in those fields. On the contrary, most session conductors work in or around the film, television, and video game industries for some time before they conduct their first session, getting their start as composers' assistants, film orchestrators, or orchestral musicians. Session conductors who manage to build a strong industry reputation and work well with music contractors can count on a steady flow of gigs.
 Finding Work
 Finding work as a session conductor is all about connections-not just with music contractors and music directors, who usually hire conductors, but also with film composers, who have a lot of power in choosing who conducts their work. Aspiring session conductors should start by working as a film orchestrator, composer, or orchestral musician to learn the ins and outs of the process. Occasionally there are gigs for an assistant session conductor, which can serve as an excellent bridge for those who are ready to transition into conducting. It can be difficult to land those first gigs but good work in a few sessions is sure to produce more opportunities.

I'm only doing my job right if I'm helping the composer get exactly what he wants.""
 Work Life
 Depending on how much music is being recorded, a conductor ´s job on a given film can take anywhere from one day to more than a week. A very small field of regulars consistently conducts for film and television. Film conductor Pete Anthony says, ""It's very rare for someone to make a living just as a film music conductor; almost all of us have to do different things."" The profession is often combined with work as an orchestrator, instrumental performer, arranger, or copyist.

Session Musician,51122,Musicians and Singers,"session musician, freelance, live performance, artists, brands, producer","? Although few people outside the music industry are aware of their vitally important role, session musicians are present in almost every hit pop song that uses real instruments rather than synthesized tracks. Boasting flawless technique, exceptional professionalism, and stylistic flexibility, they are the gold standard for polished studio playing. Whether it's a slow ballad, a driving acoustic stomp, a funky soul jam, or a brooding film score, session musicians learn the parts speedily and make adjustments to fulfill the needs of the producer or recording artist.
 
 A session player who develops a reputation as consistently reliable and easy to work with, in addition to being highly skilled and versatile, is most likely to get steady work. 
 
 In some cases, session players might receive charts, mock-up recordings, or full scores several days before the session in order to begin to learn the parts. In others, they're expected to come to the session ready to sight-read and learn charts on the fly, or even to improvise parts based on verbal instructions about the style and feel of the track. Speed and consistency are incredibly important for this kind of work, as recording schedules and budgets are almost always tight. The best session musicians in the business minimize these costs for their employers by mastering parts quickly, adjusting rapidly when the direction of the track changes, and recording in a single take.

They are self-employed, so advancement is closely tied to building a solid reputation and good relationships with producers, artists, and other session players in their region.
 
 Session musicians who form creative working relationships with recording artists might go on tour with them as part of their backing band. Session musicians might also use their skills to earn coveted positions playing in television bands. Those who work in the genre of film scores might also join orchestras, or try their hands as session conductors or music contractors.
 
 Finding Work
 Although in-house backing bands were once common Booker T and the MG's at Stax Records, for example, or the Funk Brothers at Motown most contemporary session musicians are independent contractors with freelance careers. Until they develop an industry reputation for high quality work or become the go-to backing musicians for successful recording artists or producers, a portion of every session musician's work life is devoted to finding gigs. Most jobs are found through word of mouth, so networking with producers, recording artists, recording engineers, and other session players (who may pass on gigs if they're unavailable) is essential.

 Session musicians who are punctual, organized, prepared, professional, and flexible will be well-equipped to flourish in this highly competitive field. Humility and people skills are also important; a skilled session player who develops a reputation as consistently reliable and easy to work with is more likely to find work than one who is unpleasant, inconsistent, or egotistical. Additionally, as freelancers, session players must network, promote themselves, and nurture relationships with key figures in the industry. 
 
 Work Life
 Studio work is largely centered in cities, particularly major musical hotbeds like Los Angeles, New York City, Nashville, or Atlanta. Session musicians might pick up gigs at studios all around the city, providing their own transportation. Only the absolute most successful the top-tier talent are likely to travel cross country or even internationally to play a session. Studio gigs might last anywhere from a single day to record an instrumental track for a single, to several weeks recording an artist's album in which case the session musician might temporarily live alongside the artist at the studio. Session musicians might also be picked to join artists' live backing bands or ensembles and go on tour as touring musicians.",https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/session-instrumentalist
Social Media Manager,52119,Music Business & Management,"social media manager, social, media, management, image, relationship, online, online presence, trend, fashion","What does a Social Media Manager do?
 A complex new marketing position for social-media-savvy writers and professionals, social media managers handle pretty much everything related to social media for their clients. This includes writing posts on Facebook, Twitter, and similar sites; creating and curating visual content (image and video); providing online customer service; developing long-term digital marketing campaigns and strategies; and measuring and analyzing social media data (e.g., likes, follows, and shares) and web traffic. As if that weren't enough, they are sometimes also responsible for search engine optimization (SEO). Social media managers do it all, and stay on top of new and developing tools and trends in the process.
 Increasingly, social media managers are the main point of contact between the companies and artists they represent and the feedback of users, fans, subscribers, and customers.
 The most common misconception about social media management is that it's solely about creating a ""brand"" or online persona. Social media managers, like all marketers, work toward specific and tangible goals: increasing the number of likes and shares, boosting sales, creating hype for a release, or getting visitors to sign up for email lists. Increasingly, they are also the main point of contact between the companies and artists they represent and the feedback of users, fans, subscribers, and customers-which isn ´t always positive. Social media managers prioritize comments and questions to respond to and perform critical damage control when their clients are receiving negative attention-from a wayward troll to a legitimately displeased customer.
 All told, the job performed by social media managers is as varied as the online communities and identities they cultivate. This position is constantly evolving; just five years ago, social media was still primarily the terrain of interns, not specialists. Today, more and more companies and individuals are coming to understand the importance of having a dedicated social media manager with a specialized set of skills.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Social media managers tend to have at least a bachelor's degree, and are well served by a liberal arts education. Their job is similar to another evolving position, the digital content producer. Because this is a newly established field, it's too soon to say exactly how social media managers should progress through their careers down the road. However, that's not to say that there's little opportunity for advancement-quite the opposite. Social media managers who make themselves indispensable can be promoted into newly created positions, such as director of digital marketing, and have the opportunity to forge a landmark career on the vanguard of this influential industry.
 Finding Work
 Demand for this relatively new position is extremely high. Aspirants should reach out to companies whose work and mission are of interest and inquire about their social media situation. Some businesses are still skeptical about the necessity of dedicated social media management, so prospective social media managers should be prepared to advocate for their own importance. It's also worth checking out basic job listing sites such as Indeed, Monster, LinkedIn, and Glassdoor. The first thing employers will do when considering a candidate for this position is search them on social media, so plan accordingly.

 Work Life
 Social media managers work in offices, in homes, or on the go. The job might entail traveling to and attending conferences, performances, or networking events, especially if livestreaming is part of the social media manager's responsibilities. With full-time, part-time, and contracted positions available, a social media manager's work life varies greatly.
 Still, there are some consistencies: most social media managers spend a lot of time each day dealing with online communities, and are rarely completely off the job. A new piece of information, new viral media, or a complaint from an angry customer can come at any time, and engaging with internet conversations as they develop is a pivotal part of the job. Posts and tweets can be scheduled ahead of time, but for everything else, social media managers must be constantly switched on.",https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/social-media-manager
Soloist,51122,Musicians and Singers,"soloist, independent, solo, performance, individual, skill expression, passion","? Although many players are skilled enough to perform the demanding and flashy solo parts included in certain classical pieces, a small group of musicians make a living from doing so: soloists. The classical equivalent of rock stars, soloists forgo the settled, stable life of an orchestra member so that they can perform center stage with orchestras across the world, which benefit in turn from the soloist's fame and appeal.
 
 Being a world-class player with excellent chops and a wide repertoire gets soloists on stage, but individuality is more critical to success.
 
 It's a common misconception that being a soloist is about technical ability. Yes, soloists must have world-class chops and a wide repertoire but equally important is being an excellent collaborator and quick learner, capable of forging a high level of musical cohesion with a conductor and orchestra in the span of only one or two rehearsals. Additionally, charisma and stage presence are vital to soloists, who are almost always the center of the audience's attention. Finally, what truly distinguishes a soloist from a member of the orchestra is individuality: the soloist's job is to stand out, moving and captivating audiences with their passionate performance and singular musical interpretation.
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Most soloists pursue their careers aggressively from a young age, bursting onto the world stage when they win a high-level music competition and begin to tour. Many of the most prestigious competitions are overseas, which can make participation an expensive endeavor. High placement in a competition can lead to a long and successful career as a soloist, a wealth of performance opportunities, and even the potential for major projects as a recording artist. On the other hand, low placement can make it difficult to justify continuing and trigger a switch to a career as an orchestra musician, concertmaster, or conductor.
 
 Finding Work
 Winning a prestigious competition is widely regarded as the best way to kick-start one's career as a soloist. From there, it's a matter of getting an agent, booking a tour, and setting out to test oneself on stages across the world.
 
 As freelancers, soloists don't have the steady, reliable paycheck and job security of an orchestra member. Instead, they must market themselves, actively seek out performance opportunities, take on side gigs like recording projects, and negotiate sponsorships each a major source of their livelihood.

ItÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ­s also important to be reasonable and respectful with the musicians and conductors who are a soloist's frequent collaborators. After all, a soloist who is beloved by audiences but hated by orchestras is liable to have a short career.
 
 Work Life
 Travel is nearly endless by plane, train, and occasionally car. As soloists become more popular, the area in which they perform expands. Beginning soloists might stick to a small region, but the most successful perform in world tours and hop back and forth between continents.
 
 Soloists tend to be partnered with agencies, which take a percentage of the performance fee in exchange for connecting the soloists with high-level performance opportunities, but this doesnÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ­t remove the need for constant self-promotion. Being a soloist is lucrative compared with being an orchestra member, but itÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ­s still a freelance career and an exceedingly competitive one with high expenses.

Song Plugger,52119,Music Business & Management,"song plugger, promote, pitch, ideas, potential, vision, creative","What does a Song Plugger do?
 It ´s in the interest of professional songwriters to get their songs recorded by the most successful and popular artists they can find. But record labels and big-name artists don ´t accept unsolicited musical submissions as a rule, creating a quandary for songwriters: How can they profit from their songs if they can ´t reach their best customers? That ´s where song pluggers come in. Working for clients such as independent songwriters and small music-publishing companies, song pluggers utilize their knowledge of, and reputation within, the music industry to get songs in the same room with suitable recording artists and record label teams. They may also pitch songs to music supervisors for use in television shows and movies, write detailed monthly pitch reports for their clients, and negotiate contracts and licenses once a match has been made.
 Song pluggers are music industry experts, constantly aware of which songs are doing well and which artists are looking for new material.
 While some song pluggers focus on pitching songs as described above, others style themselves as one-stop-shops for unsigned songwriters, offering managerial or A&R services to their clients. These services may include helping the songwriter record polished demos, connecting the songwriter with recording engineers and producers, or making suggestions regarding which tracks or lines the songwriter should cut or revise.
 The best song pluggers are trusted matchmakers, capable of ascertaining with a single listen whether a song can make it as a hit, and who would be best to sing it. The worst, however, are con artists, song pluggers in name only, who scam naive and inexperienced songwriters out of their money while never finding matches for the catalog. This makes it doubly important for legitimate song pluggers to develop a strong track record and reputation-not only to increase their own business, but also to distinguish themselves from predatory schemers. Song pluggers who patiently maintain their relationships and grow their reputation may find themselves in the position of representing truly exceptional songwriters and brokering industry-shaking collaborations.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Song pluggers need many years of experience in the music business and strong industry connections to be successful. Many start as employees at record labels, music publishing companies, or radio stations, or as musicians or songwriters themselves. By working in and around their specific chapter of the music industry for many years, these individuals gradually learn the business and become well-known within the industry before beginning to work as song pluggers. Song pluggers who manage to achieve a spotless reputation for bringing good songs to the table are rewarded with a constant flow of work. Successful independent song pluggers sometimes create their own artist management companies.
 Finding Work
 In order to find work, song pluggers need to be located in a musical economy where freelance songwriters are creating and providing compositions for separate recording artists-otherwise, there are no songs to plug. At this point, there are only two of these ""songwriter economies"" in the country: Los Angeles, where most contemporary pop hits are manufactured, and Nashville, where most country hits are. Aspiring song pluggers should move to one of these two cities and do whatever they can to accrue industry connections, especially within record label A&R departments. It is these very connections that ambitious and independent-thinking businesspeople leverage to become song pluggers.

 Song pluggers are music industry experts, constantly aware of things like which songs are doing well and which artists are looking for new material. They must be patient, thick-skinned, and discerning, waiting for the right song and the right moment. A single, game-changing song sometimes comes after weeks of weaker options, and pitching these weaker songs could compromise the song plugger's reputation. Finally, song pluggers are friendly, communicative, respectful, and funny-the kind of people who can be tenacious without being perceived as pushy. Their job depends on their ability to maintain professional connections with people while still aggressively pursuing their own interests.
 Work Life
 Most song pluggers are freelancers who work out of home offices or even studios. Their schedules are irregular, as song pluggers do most of their work in meetings, and meetings happen at any time of day-morning, noon, and night. In-house song pluggers have more typical hours, but are still likely to spend many late nights and weekends on networking events-showcases, festivals, concerts, awards shows, or simply social calls to maintain relationships. Song pluggers are usually paid on a contractual basis-per song-but if a song ends up being picked up for recording and passes a certain benchmark in royalties, they may receive an additional predetermined or percentage-based bonus.

Songwriter-Producer,51121,"Composition, Scoring, and Songwriting","songwriter-producer, producer, studio, beat, ","What does a Songwriter-Producer do?
 We live in a hyphenated world, and songwriter-producers-such as Ryan Tedder, Danger Mouse, Linda Perry, and Bruno Mars-are like one-stop shops for new tracks, blending the talents of a master songwriter and a top-shelf producer. Involved in every step of their songs' life cycle-from conception to revision to recording and production-songwriter-producers have unparalleled control over their product, enabling them to shape it with a broad and cohesive vision. Some songwriter-producers, like Max Martin and Greg Wells, work behind the scenes. Others, including the four mentioned above, are high-profile recording and performing artists who add their name and brand image to songs, in addition to their technical and creative prowess.
 Songwriter-producers are hired for their ability to shepherd a song from a germ of an idea to a finished product.
 Songwriter-producers may work occasionally as songwriters or producers on tracks where these roles are distinct. Most of the time, however, they are hired for their ability to shepherd a song from a germ of an idea to a finished product, produced and recorded. To do this, they employ a wide-ranging set of skills that includes programming beats and samples; playing instruments and singing; writing and revising melodies and lyrics; arranging songs; eliciting inspired performances from vocalists and musicians; and creating professional-level demos or master recordings. Songwriter-producers often develop sustained collaborative relationships with other recording artists and songwriters.

 Some start out as songwriters, others as producers, but almost all are proficient performing musicians on at least one instrument. For songwriter-producers, finding success and moving up the ladder is all about making strong tracks, participating in numerous collaborations, and building an industry reputation. Songwriter-producers who have found respect in the industry have their pick of who to work with and what to work on.
 Finding Work
 As with many gigs in the entertainment industry, finding work as a songwriter-producer comes down to talent, hard work, connections, and luck-in roughly that order. Aspiring songwriter-producers are advised to cultivate their skills, collaborate frequently, and meet as many people in the industry as possible: artists, managers, producers, and label executives.

 Songwriter-producers are often described as exceptionally hardworking. They have to be, in order to develop the large toolbox of skills required to do this work. However, just as importantly, songwriter-producers must be well-connected and collaborative. Whether it's writing as part of a team or inspiring strong performances from an artist, succeeding as a songwriter-producer sometimes comes down to basic people skills: communication and teamwork. In addition, rigorous, sustained networking is essential to landing jobs in this business.
 Work Life
 The work life of a songwriter-producer is variable and unpredictable, with no set workplace, schedule, or infrastructure. All that matters is that the songwriter-producer complete the demo, which usually requires working alone, after hours, and on a deadline for publishers. Some songs are written and produced in a day, while others take a year or more to get right. In general, songwriter-producers spend more sustained effort and solo work on projects than top-line songwriters, who often do as many as three songs a day.
 Most songwriter-producers work on a number of separate projects at the same time and fill free time (if they have any) by seeking out new collaborations, finishing demos or records, and performing side jobs like creating music libraries, producing game or sync music, and building sample packs.
 Until they make it to the big leagues and start pulling in serious royalties, most songwriter-producers will need to find a supplemental source of income; fortunately, that income can be generated from the freelance activities noted above, by working as an assistant to a more successful producer, or by working as an engineer at a recording or publishing studio.

Staff Writer,51121,"Composition, Scoring, and Songwriting","staff writer, writing, script, transcribe, create","What does a Staff Writer do?
 Often contrasted with performing songwriters, who record and perform their own compositions, staff writers are songwriters who specialize in creating hits for the commercial market. To do so, staff writers must be able to write to specification, work within distinct genres and markets, and produce demo recordings that demonstrate a song's potential.
 As content creators their audience is twofold, including both the general music-loving public and industry players like recording artists, producers, A&R management teams, and music publishing companies-all parties that could help staff writers get songs recorded and released. Royalties from recorded songs constitute the bulk of a staff writer's income, and success in this field means having the artistry to write successful songs and the business-sense and connections to ensure they find a home with a good recording artist.
 When not busy writing, staff writers are usually engaged in a host of other activities: networking, meetings, making demos, and attending shows at night.
 While a staff writer can be any songwriter who creates songs for others, in the industry the term often refers specifically to a songwriter who has signed an exclusive songwriting agreement with a publisher. This means that the publisher pays the songwriter a monthly advance and provides numerous support services, such as pitching their songs, managing their rights, and setting up cowriting sessions with other writers. In exchange, publishers receive instant publication rights to every song a staff writer creates during the contracted period, as well as the delivery of an agreed-upon annual quota of songs.
 The term ""staff writer"" is actually a misnomer, as staff writers receive neither salary nor benefits from the publisher, and as such are not actually staff. Instead, their payment is in the form of an advance-essentially, a zero-interest loan-on the future royalties earned by their songs.
 This raises an important question: Why would anyone want to be a staff writer if the job doesn't mean getting a paycheck? For one thing, music publishers have years of industry knowledge and connections that help writers get songs recorded with major label artists. For another, staff writing arrangements are still amongst the most attainable ways to work full-time as a songwriter. The advance system ensures that staff writers have enough money to quit their day job and focus their energy entirely on creating new songs. In an industry full of artists working day jobs just to get by, the appeal of this cannot be overstated.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Staff writers might rotate among gigs as a staff writer (writing the music and lyics themselves), a songwriter-producer (creating the backing track), and a top-line songwriter (creating the vocals and lyrics). Whether they work more as one or the other largely depends on which industry they're based in. The pop- and hip-hop-oriented industries of New York and Los Angeles tend to favor collaborations between songwriter-producers and top-liners, whereas the country music industry of Nashville still uses traditional, holistic songwriting techniques to create most of its material. As such, the largest working population of staff writers in the country is based in Nashville.
 Additionally, while some songwriters begin as performing artists and others as songwriters for hire, the choice is far from binding. Plenty of pop and country stars got their start writing songs for other artists before landing a record deal of their own, or vice versa. The primary career goal for success-oriented staff writers is to craft as many hit songs as possible and, through this, to develop a strong industry reputation. This serves the dual purpose of increasing their royalty-based income and improving their position at the negotiation table. Additionally, staff writers can go on to become independent song pluggers, label managers for independent labels, members of label A&R teams, or music publishers.
 Finding Work
 Most staff writers start freelance, which means they have to pitch their own songs to established industry players in the hope of catching someone's eye: the aforementioned recording artists, A&R teams, producers, and music publishers. This is a daunting and difficult stage-learning how to navigate the record industry is a lifelong process for those without preexisting connections-but it's one that almost all staff writers must overcome. Those who make it seek out collaborations with more established writers, network at every industry event and concert they can attend, drop off demos of their work with publishers, shamelessly self-promote, build professional websites with samples of their work, and even perform their own compositions at venues that are known as industry hotbeds.
 Freelance songwriters who are struggling might consider working with a song plugger, a sort of independent A&R professional who pitches songs to labels and publishers. When considering hiring a song plugger, one should thoroughly investigate their reputation and legitimacy, and consult with an entertainment attorney before signing a contract.

 Songwriting ability can only be developed by writing songs. Finding success as a staff writer, however, is a completely different matter; this requires networking, self-promotion, and entrepreneurial skills, as well as good business-sense. In order to even reach the starting line, staff writers must be incredibly tenacious and hardworking. On the other hand, making it in the long run might be more about the ability to assess the current music scene and write songs that are well-positioned to become hits. This requires an ability to critique one's own work and an open-mindedness when it comes to compositional style.
 Work Life
 While some cling to the myth that songwriters are beholden to a muse and create when inspiration strikes, the truth is that songwriting is a business, a practice, and a habit. While Nashville staff writers are likely to work set hours in the office of their publisher, professional staff writers in other industries are almost always their own bosses and must set their own hours, working out of home studios.
 When not busy writing, staff writers are usually engaged in a host of other activities: networking, meetings, making demos, and attending shows at night. While most think of songwriting as a solitary art, staff writers collaborate frequently, and may participate in multiple songwriting sessions in a single day. Most beginning songwriters work a day job in a related field-teaching music, producing demos, or assisting at industry firms-while staff writers can focus exclusively on writing music. The major industries for staff writers are located in Nashville, New York City, and Los Angeles.

 While a home studio can be as simple as a computer, an audio interface, and a microphone set up in a bedroom corner, creating a professional-level recording studio requires the expertise of a studio designer. In addition to drawing up designs for new studio spaces, studio designers perform a number of related tasks, including:
 Modifying the size, shape, proportions, and materials of existing spaces to improve the acoustic environment
 Solving problems related to a room's dimensions, sound absorption and separation, and frequency management
 Outfitting spaces with features such as floating doors, double walls, and extra ceilings
 Creating separate functional spaces like control rooms, live rooms, and isolation/vocal booths
 Although the rise of the inexpensive home studio has affected the market, good design remains critical to the artistic and financial success of a professional recording studio, ensuring continued demand for the best in the field. The best studio designers do much more than simply build recording studios; being a studio designer means balancing two equally important goals: to create a musically accurate recording and monitoring environment, and to provide a space for musicians that feels natural and enhances creativity. The ultimate goal is an aesthetic design that improves functionality.

 Career Path
 In school, studio designers may study production, recording, architecture, or acoustical science. Advanced degrees may be necessary for breaking into this profession, but a highly regarded body of work and strong references will do far more to generate work. Many studio designers have previous experience as engineers, producers, or musicians, and break into the field as apprentices or assistants to an established studio designer. Many also begin as acoustical consultants, a field with significant crossover.
 Finding Work
 Studio designers, like all independent contractors, benefit greatly from a network of industry contacts and a large pool of returning customers, including studio owners, producers, composers, and musicians. Most enter the field with pre-existing connections from prior work in the studio.
 With the rise of digital technology, the number of professional studios-and the amount of high-end work for studio designers-saw a dip. However, now that many professionals are working out of home studios, they require professional-grade studio design services, creating new opportunities for studio designers.

Studio Manager,52113,Audio and video recording technicians,"studio manager, organizing, scheduling, managing, artist manager, studio, audio,","What does a Studio Manager do?
 Whether running a one-room outpost or a bustling big-city complex, studio managers are responsible for the smooth and profitable operation of a recording studio. Their widely ranging duties can include coordinating with artists, producers, managers, and labels to schedule recording sessions; hiring and supervising recording engineers, assistants, and other technical and creative staff; helping to select the studio's equipment; and-critically-marketing the studio to potential new clients.
 Accounting tasks such as payroll and billing may also fall to the studio manager, although those who manage large studios typically will delegate such duties to hired staff. In small studios, the studio manager may also be the lead recording engineer.
 While the specific duties of the studio manager differ greatly based on factors like the studio's size or the owner's involvement, client satisfaction is a core part of almost every studio manager's job. The studio manager keeps close track of ongoing projects to ensure that they are on schedule and that clients' specific needs are being met (e.g., hiring a piano tuner before the piano-playing pop star's session). In some cases, the studio manager will assign recording and mixing engineers to specific projects. Because attracting clients relies largely on the appeal of a strong reputation and word-of-mouth referrals, keeping track of customers' needs in this way is crucial to generating new business.

 Career Path
 There are no formal educational requirements for this senior position. Most studio managers have experience as recording engineers, mixing engineers, or producers. Some, however, work their way up after working in project management, studio booking, or as administrative assistants. Successful studio managers might find work at more prestigious studios, buy in to become co-owner of a studio, or open their own studio.
 Finding Work
 Studio managers work for recording studios of all shapes and sizes, including those that focus on ADR and voice work rather than music. While an experienced lead recording engineer might qualify for studio manager positions advertised online, most must first work their way up the ladder from entry-level jobs and internships at recording studios.

In studio managers' capacity as artist relations managers, communication and networking abilities are valuable.

Studio Owner,52113,Audio and video recording technicians,"studio owner, finance, renting, lending, studio, business, audio,","What does a Studio Owner do?
 Studio owners-who are frequently former recording engineers and musicians-are the professionals responsible for establishing, constructing, and running the recording studio as a business. While the studio owner has chief creative control of the studio and final say in all decisions concerning it, that doesn't mean he or she runs it alone. Studio owners often hire studio designers to assist with design and construction, recording and maintenance engineers to select and purchase equipment, and studio managers to hire the remaining staff and run the studio's day-to-day operations.
 While small studio owners may stay closely involved with the studio after setup, even working as recording engineers or managers, owners of large studios typically assume a more hands-off role: networking in the record industry and utilizing those connections to attract new clients, as well as approving all the studio's major financial decisions. They also oversee the studio's continuing growth, which means finding investors, planning the construction or purchase of new spaces, and potentially developing the studio's marketing and branding strategies.

 Career Path
 There are no educational requirements to open or own a studio, although knowledge of recording, studio design, and the record industry goes a long way. In fact, most studio owners are former recording engineers, recording artists, producers, and A&R representatives who-after spending their whole lives in studios run by others-wish to create studios that reflect their own values.
 Finding Work
 Finding work as a studio owner means acquiring the funds and technical knowledge to purchase or construct a studio. It also means knowing people in the music industry who can serve as the studio's early clients.

 Being a good studio owner doesn't have anything to do with being a good recording engineer; it has to do with understanding how to hire a good team, delegate responsibilities effectively, and use networking and marketing to grow a business. Additionally, long-term planning and critical thinking skills are essential.
 Work Life
 Studio owners may work at the studio as an engineer or manager, work regular business hours from a separate office, or provide leadership remotely while touring as a musician or running a nationwide chain of studios.

Talent Buyer,62101,Music Business & Management,"talent buyer, scout, eye, taste, genre, style, lookout","What does a Talent Buyer do?
 Talent buyers are responsible for identifying and booking the appropriate talent for a particular venue or event, as well as managing the show's budget, assessing whether the bill will sell, and determining whether a more vigorous promotional campaign is needed to fill seats. The process varies greatly depending on demand for the venue, the venue's size, and the talent buyer's own employment situation. For example, while a talent buyer working for a venue focuses on finding artists, talent buyers who work for production companies likely need to find venues in addition to artists.
 A good ear is paramount for assessing a band's level, and strong communication skills are essential for negotiating with agents of more established acts. The most successful talent buyers also have a deep understanding of musical taste, genre, and audience; scoring a highly regarded act means nothing if the booking doesn't appeal to the core audience that typically fills the venue. There are many other ideas to consider before making an offer to an entertainer, including acoustics and setup; competing events; fair ticket prices; projected refreshment sales; and the potential need for an opening act. Depending on their employer, talent buyers may also hire the production team, secure equipment, and advertise the events. They work closely with venue managers, concert promoters, and event operations coordinators.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 One doesn't necessarily need a college degree to work as a talent buyer, but an education in sales and marketing or music business could be a huge help-both in doing the job and getting hired for it. Most begin the career with an internship at a concert promotion company or as the assistant talent buyer for a large venue, positions in which they can learn the basics of the industry. Talent buyers can go on to become concert promoters, venue managers, or festival directors-members of the live music industry with whom they work closely.
 Finding Work
 Talent buyers work for many live performance organizations including music, theater, and other live-entertainment venues; music or event promotion companies; and festival organizations. Aspiring talent buyers should seek out an internship at any of the above companies, ideally one that offers experience booking artists or venues. One can also show commitment and drive by attending as many shows as possible and meeting venue managers and other live-music industry players face-to-face.

 Interpersonal Skills
 This role revolves around relationship development and industry knowledge, so good talent buyers have an excellent memory for names, faces, policies, audiences, and music. An analytical, organized, and detail-oriented mind helps keep track of the many variables involved in planning a concert, and how each variable might affect profit, reputation, and other measures of success.
 Multitasking skills are essential to talent buyers, who are usually corresponding with many different artists and teams at once, each for different dates or even different venues. Ideally, they're also congenial people with whom bands and agents would want to work with again.
 Work Life
 Whether working out of a small in-venue office, an affiliated office in a separate building, or from home, talent buyers generally keep standard business hours, during which time they research acts, make deals, and solidify their venue's calendar. While the main job takes place during the day and behind a desk, talent buyers often need to be on hand at the venue at night and on weekends to ensure that the artists are happy with the booking, or simply to act as the face of the venue.

Teaching Artist,51122,Music Education,"teaching, artist, teach, education, instructor","What does a Teaching Artist do?
 For professional artists, educational institutions have long been havens: providing much-needed funding and consistency through temporary positions like visiting artist and artist-in-residence. In contrast with these short-term positions, however, is an emerging career based around equal committment to the arts and education: the teaching artist. Teaching artists are neither musicians who give lessons to pay the bills until their big break comes nor great actors who give an occasional master class. Rather, they are working artists who acquire training in education and make it central to their professional life. They are committed to the marriage of pedagogy and artistry, using their work as artists to inform their teaching and vice versa.
 Teaching artists might find that their careers and lives lean more towards the arts at one time and more towards education at another, and success could come from either direction-or both.
 Because this is an emerging field, some murkiness still surrounds the public understanding of what a teaching artist does. Perhaps the best-or at least broadest-definition of a teaching artist is someone whose goal is to provide a tangible link between the creative process and arts-based learning. That is to say that teaching artists use their ongoing experiences as professional artists to develop their own curricula, lesson plans, and academic approaches. In addition to working in a school setting at K-12 schools and universities, teaching artists might also use arts-based education to work with groups including young children, business leaders, museum patrons, hospital patients, and prison inmates. Sometimes the goal is a practical technique-based education, while other times it's exposing students to new ways to express themselves emotionally and think creatively.

 Career Path
 Being a teaching artist is as much a way of life as it is an emerging career. Most study their art as undergraduates and work as professional artists before discovering and pursuing an interest in education. Specific teaching certificates and advanced degrees in education could be necessary, depending on the type of positions one is pursuing. Teaching artists might find that their careers and lives lean more towards the arts at one time and more towards education at another, and success could come from either direction-or both. Still, teaching artists who work full-time at K-12 schools are well positioned to become program directors, while those who work for universities and conservatories could become higher education administrators, granting them increased responsibilities.
 Finding Work
 Teaching artists practice a wide range of arts, including music, dance, drama, opera, film, and writing. They might be employed by K-12 schools and private studios as traditional music teachers, dance teachers, and drama teachers, or by universities as professors. Teaching artists might also seek special training to work as early childhood educators, adaptive arts educators, or dance, drama, or music therapists. Freelance teaching artists could take performance/education jobs in non-traditional settings such as community centers, museums, hospitals, senior centers, homeless shelters, prisons, and social service agencies. This is often done through an educational nonprofit organization.
 Professional Skills
 Practical arts knowledge: music, dance, theater, visual arts, writing, etc.

 Interpersonal Skills
 Teaching artists must have the ability to convert their artistic experiences into professional and educational approaches, infusing their teaching with authenticity, practicality, and depth-the qualities that separate teaching artists from non-practicing arts teachers and constitute the bulk of their appeal. The best teaching artists combine this unique perspective with lesson planning, classroom management, and communication skills. Confidence, public speaking abilities, and leadership qualities can only help.
 Work Life
 Jobs for teaching artists may be full time, part time, seasonal, or short-term (e.g. a residency, teaching series, or workshop). Teaching artists' work lives vary greatly depending on their employment situation, as well as the balance they're seeking between making art and teaching. Those who have steady employment at a school are likely to have a consistent schedule, while teaching artists who prefer to do nonprofit work may bounce from job to job.

 Technology trainers and specialists help customers and colleagues-such as sales associates-learn to use a company's instruments, tools, and other music-related products. One specific variety of technology specialist is the product representative: a professional musician with excellent chops who demonstrates the full capabilities of a musical product in videos and trade-show demonstrations.
 Some trainers specialize in particular tools while others are fluent in a variety of programs. A guitarist might funnel their skill into doing demos and trainings for manufacturers like Fender or Marshall Amps, while a percussionist might demonstrate the capabilities of a new sampling pad or trigger. Recording engineers may find opportunities at tool manufacturers like Cubase or PreSonus. Other companies, such as ProTools and Ableton, also offer hardware and software for musicians, and even administer their own certification programs so that their most advanced users can become certified trainers of their products.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 A college degree in computer science, engineering, or electronic production can help one find positions at software-oriented companies. On the other hand, demonstrated interest, ability, and creativity might be all that's necessary to land a gig as a product representative. A successful technology trainer might move up the ranks at a company to become the head of education, managing the broad strategies used to instruct others in the use of the product. They might also become product managers, working at the intersection of marketing and product design.
 Finding Work
 Technology trainers and product representatives work for a wide variety of companies, including those that sell products like music editing software, music notation software, music production software, electronic instruments (including both controllers and synthesizers), and musical equipment (e.g. amps and mics), as well as for online schools and certification programs.

 Interpersonal Skills
 Technology specialists are technology-savvy educators who love nothing more than to dive into a software program and learn every inch of its capabilities. They're the type of people who fix everyone else's computer, or teach them how to fix their own. An interest in education is essential, as well as the patience necessary to see it through.
 For product representatives, perhaps the most important qualities are curiousness, creativity, and a sense of exploration. Creators of digital instruments and musical tools want to demonstrate the capabilities of their tools in a highly musical context. Ideally, they want musicians who are genuinely excited about the tools, using them to do things that would be impossible otherwise.
 Work Life
 The work life of a technology trainer varies based on their employers and clients. Some work standard office hours behind a desk, responding to product-related queries via email. Others travel across the country giving demonstrations to school departments, musicians, and music stores, which often means working evenings and weekends.
 Working as a product representative is usually a part-time gig for a professional musician. This typically involves recording videos that demonstrate the product, as well as demoing the product live at industry events and trade shows such as NAMM

Television Band Member,51122,Musicians and Singers,"television, band, live band, TV, background,","? Live bands are a vibrant part of live television shows, playing background music for sketches, accompanying guest performers, and entertaining the audience during commercial breaks. For professional musicians, membership in a show's house band provides many elusive and coveted perks, including a steady paycheck, employer benefits, and a significant career boost. Although some television programs feature established bands, such as the Roots on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, most hire bandleaders or music directors to assemble an ensemble from scratch.
 
 Within the larger groups of session and touring musicians, only the best of the best those who always come prepared, memorize difficult charts in the blink of an eye, and never miss a note are qualified to become television band members.
 
 A typical day for a late-night band member begins around 10:00 a.m. with a band meeting, during which the group maps out and rehearses the day's musical tasks, and also records any pieces that won't be played live. The pieces played by television bands include shorter segments play-on music and commercial bumps as well as lengthier compositions: the music played underneath skits, as accompaniment for performers and guest musicians, or to entertain the audience during commercial breaks. Once night has fallen, it's time to tape the main show. During the show, band members might interact with the audience, deliver comical dialogue or spin off spontaneous interactions with the host, or even play small parts in sketches.

Top-Line Songwriter,51121,"Composition, Scoring, and Songwriting","top-line, top line, topline, songwriter,","What does a Top-Line Songwriter do?
 With the invention and proliferation of synthesizers and music production software, music producers and songwriters gained the power to create fully produced songs and recordings without ever hiring a musician. These so-called songwriter-producers went on to rule the mainstream music industry-meaning commercial genres like pop, rap, and EDM-with their expertly (and cheaply) produced instrumental compositions. However, there remained one element they struggled to fabricate: vocals, the so-called ""top line"" of a musical track. Emerging to fill this void, top-line songwriters began to work closely with producers, creating compelling melodies, harmonies, and lyrics to sit atop their instrumental tracks. Today, most mainstream hits by top recording artists are the product of collaboration between a songwriter-producer and a top-line songwriter.
 In order to succeed in this field, one needs an excellent singing voice, masterful lyric and melody-writing ability, the ability to improvise, good business sense, and an attentive grasp on the current musical landscape.
 Toplining is an idiosyncratic process, at times requiring a methodical, compositional approach and at others an experimental, improvisational one. When working on a track, top-line songwriters frequently start by coming up with several core vocal melodies-""hooks""-and words or phrases that seem to match the tone of the track (or the producer's requested topic). Over time and through much trial and error, these ideas are refined into developed sections like verse and chorus. When the song is just about finished, the topliner records the lead and background vocals, creating a vocal demo that acts both as a tool for selling the song to recording artists and their managers, and as a blueprint for the eventual singer.

 Career Path
 Most top-line songwriters get their introduction to the industry as performing songwriters, staff writers, session vocalists, or even recording artists. The line between artist and writer is often porous, and many continue to advance artist careers alongside their work as a top-line songwriter. Talented and driven top-line songwriters can become major industry players, receiving a steady flow of work and contributing to chart-topping hits. Additionally, many top-line songwriters become successful recording artists in their own right.
 Finding Work
 Aspiring top-line songwriters should set up shop in a music-industry-heavy city like New York City, Los Angeles, Atlanta, or Nashville. Recording vocal demos for other artists, doing live and studio gigs as a backup singer, and participating in group writing sessions are all great ways to begin cultivating connections with professionals like studio managers, music producers, recording artists, managers, and music publishers-all of whom could help one catch a career break. Considerable networking might be required to find one's first gigs as a topliner.
 Lesser known remixers and songwriter-producers might also look for remote collaborators online, opportunities which can be excellent for beginning topliners looking to build their r sum . In absence of early gigs like these, one could use free online backing tracks to practice toplining and create a demo reel. One top-line songwriter even recommends using a single track to create multiple distinct top lines, demonstrating creative flexibility.

 Interpersonal Skills
 Perhaps the most important quality for a top-line songwriter is the ability to collaborate. Songs are rarely perfect on the first try, which is why the best top-line songwriters know how to effectively self-critique and incorporate feedback from others. That aside, in order to succeed in this field, one needs an excellent singing voice, the ability to create distinctive and expressive lyrics and melodies, improvisatory skills, good business sense, and an attentive grasp on the current musical landscape. Ester Dean, who has written songs for industry giants like Rihanna and Nicki Minaj, says that ""long-term success in this business comes from being able to change with the times....songwriters need to understand that music is always changing.""
 Work Life
 Generally speaking, there are two kinds of gigs for top-line songwriters: studio gigs, where the top-line songwriters works in person with the tracks' producer(s); and remote gigs, where the topliner receives a track over email and fires back stems of their own vocal recording, usually created in a home or private studio. In-person studio sessions might last anywhere from a couple of days to a week, during which time the top-liner generally works on a large number of tracks. On the other hand, remote gigs usually have a very quick turnaround, mainly due to the fact that producers often send the same track out to multiple top-liners who compete for the songwriting credit. For this reason, songwriters who prefer to work from home must be ready to work at any time in order to get an edge on the competition.

Tour Manager,52119,Music Business & Management,"tour, manager, bands, groups, travel","What does a Tour Manager do?
 Tour managers take care of nearly every aspect of the lives of musicians and crew while on the road, providing organizational, administrative, and boots-on-the-ground support for the duration of a concert tour. They make transportation and lodging arrangements; communicate in advance with concert producers and venue management to coordinate load-in, sound check, and set times; convey the band's hospitality needs (backstage catering and dressing room setup); see to it that musicians and crew get to their next stop safely and on time; and ensure that the artist's rider requests are met.
 The best tour managers are well-prepared for the issues and crises that sometimes arise on tour, and deal with them resourcefully and efficiently.
 Tour managers create day sheets that detail each day's schedule and distribute them to the band and crew. If there are media engagements planned-such as a record store appearance, a radio station visit, or an interview-the tour manager is responsible for making sure everyone is where they need to be. Perhaps most importantly, the tour manager manages the tour's finances, keeping a close eye on the money that comes in and out to ensure everything stays within the tour accountant's budget. When a problem arises, whether it's due to a dispute with a promoter, a passport emergency, guest list gaffes, or the artist's own bad behavior, it's the tour manager's job to resolve the issue and restore peace. In some cases, tour managers work closely with a tour publicist to ensure attendance of the shows, and those who work on smaller tours might take on additional duties, such as overseeing production elements like lighting and sound or working the merch table.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Some tour managers start out as musicians or concert techs; others have experience as festival staff, booking agents, promoters, or live sound engineers, or in similar live-music roles. With experience, connections, and a reputation for good work, tour managers can advance to better-paying jobs with more prominent bands and artists, or join the ranks of a record label or concert promotion company. They can also go into other aspects of management, becoming an artist manager, venue manager, artist relations manager, or company manager to an orchestra.
 Finding Work
 Tour management is typically freelance work, although the most experienced tour managers may be able to snag in-house positions at record labels. It's vital that aspiring tour managers have proven experience living on the road and managing a creative undertaking. As with many live music gigs, getting hired as a tour manager is often a matter of word-of-mouth referrals. To get started, some tour managers do the work for little or no pay with a friend's band.

The best tour managers are well-prepared for the issues and crises that sometimes arise on tour, and deal with them resourcefully and efficiently. They should also be capable of handling interpersonal conflicts-which occur frequently on tour-with grace.
 Work Life
 It's easy to forget that managing a tour means going on tour oneself. Just like the musicians and crew members they manage, tour managers spend hours riding in cars, buses, and/or planes, work long days that continue well into the night, and sleep in hotels and motels in unfamiliar cities. They also enjoy all the benefits of going on tour: paid travel, free concerts, and new experiences and opportunities around every corner. It's vitally important for a tour manager's long-term success and well-being that he or she enjoys life on the road, highs and lows alike.

Tour Publicist,52119,Music Business & Management,"tour, touring, publicist, marketing, travel, merchandise","What does a Tour Publicist do?
 A type of publicist, the tour publicist specializes in promoting interest in and drawing attention to an act's live shows. Like a more traditional album-oriented publicist, the tour publicist typically kicks off a promotional campaign by crafting a media release and reaching out to local and national music journalists to secure an advance story or review.
 From there, however, the job branches off. Tour publicists reach out to radio and television stations in each city the tour is passing through to set up interviews and schedule appearances, creating local buzz. For larger acts, tour publicists may also contact fan clubs and record stores to arrange meet-and-greets, autograph sessions, and in-store performances.
 Unlike album publicists, tour publicists travel with the acts they represent so they can run interference at personal appearances, communicate with the media on the band's behalf, and make sure promotional events run smoothly and stay on schedule. On show nights, the tour publicist is ensconced at the venue, greeting invited journalists, bloggers, and photographers, and handing out media credentials and backstage passes.
 Tour publicists are unlikely to work with smaller acts, as their duties are usually handled by a single all-purpose publicist. If by some chance a tour publicist does represent a small act, he or she probably won't travel with the band. Instead, the publicist will focus on advance work, such as pitching coverage; arranging ticket giveaways on college radio; and spreading the word about shows on social media.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Any publicist who works for a record label, public relations firm, or entertainment company might be assigned to travel with an act as a tour publicist. But while most return afterward to the typical publicist career path-advancing to become first a senior publicist and then a publicity director-some find that they love life on the road, and excel in this fast-paced and unpredictable environment. Specialized tour publicists with proven track records tend to work with the biggest artists in the business on high-budget tours that bring them all over the world.
 Finding Work
 Internships are the way to go when trying to break into the world of publicity, and many public relations companies offer development programs for students and recent graduates. Aspiring publicists can also promote friends' shows to gain publicity experience, or they can contribute to a music blog to hone writing skills.

 Flexibility and problem-solving skills are key for tour publicists, who work in a fast-paced and unpredictable environment. When a radio appearance is double-booked or a key journalist doesn't show, tour publicists must make quick changes to ensure the band doesn't lose momentum for the night's show.
 The ability to get along with many kinds of people is a must, as is the capacity to remain calm under pressure and when things don't go as planned. Finally, exceptional organizational, time-management, and multitasking skills are vital in order to stay on top of the job while also dealing with a rigorous travel schedule.
 Work Life
 While musicians have their fair share of downtime on tour, there's rarely a dull moment for the tour publicist. In the weeks and months leading up to a tour, publicists work the phones and email like crazy, setting up as much media coverage and as many promotional opportunities ahead of time as possible. They continue to do so while on the road, conducting business in the corner of a noisy club, on a crowded tour bus, or in a motel. Specialized tour publicists catch their breath when the touring period is over, regrouping and recovering at home for a period before setting out again.

Touring Musician,51122,Musicians and Singers,"tour, touring, musician, travel, gig, road, independence, independent","? Some say that life on tour is nothing but truck-stop burgers and dirty laundry. Others say it's the nonstop rush of adoring fans and the open road. These stereotypes get one thing right: life on tour is made up of a mix of highs and lows that nearly all musicians orchestra members, singer-songwriters, recording artists, and side players alike experience at some point in their careers. A tour may be as short as a week or as long as a year, with occasional nights off or, on truly lengthy tours, longer periods for recharging at home built into the itinerary.
 
 Musicians who are flexible, free-spirited, and resilient will find it easier to navigate the stresses of life on the road than those who are attached to a prescribed schedule or lifestyle.
 
 A typical day for a touring musician begins with a drive from one city to another, followed by load-in and sound check at the venue. In the afternoon, there might be a promotional visit to a local radio station or record store. Once this wraps up, and before the pre-show phase begins, touring musicians often try to squeeze in some time for exercising, emailing, sightseeing, pleasure reading, or simply catching up on rest. In the early evening, it's time to gather back at the venue. The pre-show might involve vocal warm-ups, makeup, costuming, writing a set list, or running through some last-minute changes. After the show, the musicians usually spend time at the merch table, meeting and greeting fans. Then it's time to pack up. Unless they are on a well-funded tour with roadies to do the heavy lifting, musicians pack up and load out their own instruments and equipment. Contrary to popular myth, hard partying is not required. In fact, most musicians hightail it back to the hotel or motel to get a decent night's rest before waking up and getting ready for the next show.

Touring musicians have diverse backgrounds; some get their first touring experience as concert techs for established acts, others as members of original bands, orchestras, or pit orchestras. Beginning touring musicians might audition with music directors and managers to earn spots on tours, while more experienced touring musicians might be offered the job based on reputation, word of mouth, or a previous experience playing together on a different tour.

 Some musicians tour with orchestras, bands, or ensembles they're already a part of, in which case they either hire an agent to book their tours or do the work themselves identifying the regions where they want to play, researching and making contact with venue managers and talent buyers, and sending out links to their music in the hope of booking a show.
 
 Professional touring musicians, on the other hand, are usually auditioned and hired by a band or artist's music director, or in some cases their manager. First-time touring musicians are unlikely to be hired without significant prior touring experience and proven performance abilities. It's all word of mouth, so networking abilities are important.

 Interpersonal Skills
 Musicians who are flexible, free-spirited, and resilient thrive on tour. Communication skills are also vital, as the stress of touring can and often does trigger interpersonal conflicts between bandmates. Additionally, road life is notorious for offering unhealthy temptations; a little bit of discipline, maturity, and professionalism can go a long way. In terms of performance, playing for a new crowd each night requires immense flexibility as a performer, and acts for less experienced players as a practical crash course in connecting with an audience.
 
 Work Life
 There's a reason musicians still tour when so much else about the music industry has changed. Touring offers the opportunity for musicians to connect with their listeners on a personal level, in the flesh. And for those who are thirsty for new experiences, going on tour promises a wealth of them; every day on tour is different and full of surprises. Still, whether traveling on a shoestring or in relative comfort, life on tour presents certain challenges: long stretches away from loved ones; sleeping in a different bed every night; trying to eat well and stay fit while dealing with boredom and lengthy drives; acclimating to transience and then readjusting to life at home. All of it can wear down even the hardiest musicians, which is why self-care is especially vital for touring musicians.",https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/touring-musician
Transcriber,51121,"Composition, Scoring, and Songwriting","transcriber, transcribe, writing, writer, copier","What does a Transcriber do?
 Most trained musicians are capable of basic musical transcription, but only a few possess the skills and attention to detail necessary to work as transcribers. Transcribers, who often also pursue careers as composers, conductors, or arrangers, use their thorough knowledge of audio notation and editing software, their experience with music notation, and their highly developed ears to create detailed scores, lead sheets, and guitar tablature from nothing more than a recording. Successful transcribers must be able to parse crowded arrangements, work through compressed or low-quality recordings, capture the nuance of improvisatory solos, and reformat a score to facilitate quick comprehension.
 Transcribers are detail-oriented workers who are perfectionistic in their pursuit of an accurate and visually simplified score.
 The primary employer group for transcribers is music publishers. These organizations rely on transcribers in order to produce bound books of sheet music for songs by their most popular artists. Often, these books feature rearrangements of the songs in question for popular formats like piano/voice/guitar or solo piano, and it's the task of the transcriber to create said arrangements. Other clients include amateur musicians, academic institutions, and music performance groups such as jazz bands, orchestras, and cover bands. Transcribers mostly work freelance, and often offer a variety of related services in the field of music preparation.

 Career Path
 Although some may manage to make a living working exclusively as transcribers, for most, this job is just one of many ways for highly trained musicians to use their skill sets in an entrepreneurial fashion-in other words, to pay the bills while continuing work on creative endeavors, like individual composition or performing in an ensemble. Those who do make a living entirely as transcribers usually work for music publishers or music-based video games.
 Transcription work goes hand-in-hand with other forms of music preparation like copying, proofreading, and orchestrating. As arrangement is a large part of working as a transcriber, many transcribers go on to become professional arrangers.
 Finding Work
 To find their first clients, freelance transcribers typically utilize connections formed while working as a musician. Those interested in expanding their transcription services into a long-term professional venture are advised to make a website, advertise on the internet, and post flyers around conservatories and other high-volume music programs.
 In order to get a job transcribing for a music publishing company, transcribers should choose a music publisher, investigate that publisher thoroughly and gain a sense of its notational style, and then submit a strong portfolio that reflects that style.

 Interpersonal Skills
 Transcribers are detail-oriented workers who are perfectionistic in their pursuit of an accurate and visually simplified score. Transcription is a time-consuming art, and good transcribers are capable of working for hours alone without losing focus. Everyone makes mistakes, but transcribers who don ´t catch and correct their own find that work dries up quickly. Contending with numerous deadlines, transcribers must also have excellent organizational and time-management skills.
 Work Life
 Transcription is a common freelance job for professional musicians who also support themselves through other means: performing as a general business musician or working as a music educator, for example. The job generally consists of remote work. Those who want to work as transcribers should be prepared for hours alone with headphones on, listening, rewinding, and internally debating notation choices. Nowadays, with most audio files shared over the internet, transcribers are unlikely even to meet their clients in person.

Venue Manager,52119,Music Business & Management,"venue, manager, finance, management, organization","What does a Venue Manager do?
 There is a world of work to be done at a venue before and after fans descend for a show. The person in charge of getting it done is the venue manager, who supervises the day-to-day operations of a club or concert hall. With administrative, logistical, and creative duties in both the front- and back-of-house, there's never a dull moment.
 Supervise
 Venue managers hire, train, schedule, and supervise in-house staff such as ushers, bartenders, box office employees, maintenance personnel, and security. They also keep track of the safety and cleanliness of the facility, and ensure proper maintenance of in-house gear and equipment. Additionally, they may manage payroll for their employees.
 Coordinate
 Venue managers communicate and coordinate with performers before and after shows. Depending on the size of the venue and the acts coming through, they may work closely with the performer's agent, tour manager, sound engineer, lighting crew chief, and other touring team members. Venue managers also arrange hospitality for artists and their entourage.
 Some venue managers-generally those at smaller clubs-book and promote shows themselves. At larger venues, though, that job is typically outsourced to talent buyers and concert promotion companies. Especially enterprising club managers come up with creative ways to fill their rooms, including scheduling theme nights, creating artist residencies, and planning other special events.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 One of the most senior positions in the venue, venue managers typically begin their careers by performing one or more entry-level roles involved in the daily operation of a venue, such as usher, bartender, stage manager, or box office associate. It can also be useful to have knowledge of and prior experience in live sound engineering, lighting, or touring. Diversity of experience is vital, as the venue manager needs to understand every facet of running a venue in order to delegate tasks effectively and solve problems that arise.
 Some venue managers come to this career from related fields, such as theater management, restaurant management, tour management, or event management. As this position is the top of the ladder, venue managers may advance by finding jobs at larger or more prestigious venues, by managing multiple venues (typically through a larger venue management organization), or by starting their own venue as a business owner.
 Finding Work
 Venue managers typically work for nightclubs, theaters, concert halls, amphitheaters, and larger venue management companies. They may find positions through business connections, job listings, or word-of-mouth, or be promoted internally.

 Interpersonal Skills
 Because running a venue is predicated on building an effective team, the best managers have exceptional communication, leadership, and multitasking skills. Time management is critical: venue managers need to know how to delegate tasks well, work quickly and effectively, and keep multiple balls in the air.
 Work Life
 The work life of a venue manager varies greatly based on factors such as management style, venue size, and staff structure. Some venue managers work fairly regular schedules, spending the majority of their time in the office making calls, building schedules, and handling paperwork. Others work in a more hands-on capacity, regularly supervising performances at night and on weekends. The majority land somewhere in the middle, with a mix of in-person supervision and daily administrative work making for an irregular schedule. And with the responsibility of responding quickly to problems resting on their shoulders, venue managers must be ready to work at any hour.

Virtual Reality Content Creator,52119,Motion pictures and broadcasting,"virtual reality, content creator, media, platform, online, followers, computer, social","What does a Virtual Reality Content Creator do?
 Virtual reality (VR) is an exciting new medium with broad applications in entertainment, marketing, design, and more. Every bit as flexible and dynamic are the professionals who specialize in creating and adapting content for virtual reality. VR content creators use two main methods to create VR content: computer-generation, wherein every part of the world is synthetic, designed and integrated into an interactive experience using code; and 360-degree video, where video is taken using an omnidirectional camera and edited to create an immersive experience.
 360-Degree Immersive Video
 By far the least expensive and speediest method of creating virtual reality content is 360-degree video. Of course, that doesn't mean it's easy or cheap: video is shot using an omnidirectional camera, spliced together using special video stitching software, and edited further in order to be optimized for viewing on a head-mounted display (HMD). Frequently, content creators will fill more than one role on a single project, but VR content creators who work in this medium can take on a number of jobs, including:
 direction-conceiving and leading the project;
 filming-setting up tripods, guiding the Steadicam, or piloting a drone-mounted camera;
 audio capture-setting up lavalier mics or even sitting directly beneath the tripod; and
 postproduction.
 As far as the projects themselves, 360-degree video can support fictional narratives and nonfiction documentaries, just like traditional video, but it's particularly effective when it comes to marketing and event management. The ability to live broadcast VR content allows sports games, concerts, conferences, and trade-shows to become immersive experiences for audiences at home, while brands take advantage of the eye-catching medium to capture viewers on sites such as Facebook and Youtube. Video-based VR also has cutting-edge applications in fields such as tourism, real estate, education, and surveillance-military and otherwise.
 Interactive 3D Development
 The ""virtual"" in virtual reality is why most people tend to picture this kind of content when they think of putting on a VR headset. If creating video-based VR content is like making a film, then creating interactive VR content is like developing a video game. Creators use 3D game development software-called ""engines""-to build entire worlds from the ground up. This often means creating original 3D models and animations with software such as 3DS Max or Maya; using applications such as Photoshop or Zbrush to add color and texture; using the engine's built-in tools to add lighting to the scene; and designing original sound effects
 (Opens in a new window)
 to bring the visual content to life. Perhaps most importantly, interactive VR content creators write code-using the advanced functionality provided by the game engine-to tie everything together.
 While this method of creating VR content is much more expensive and time-consuming than shooting 360-degree video, it has the advantage of interactivity-thanks to the code-meaning that users can do much more than just look around. The ability to pick things up, move around, and edit virtual objects in an immersive environment makes interactive VR excellent for computer-aided design (CAD) as well as video game-style entertainment. Autodesk ´s VRED, for example, is a virtual prototyping software for automotive designers that allows them to see and edit their designs at scale without needing to build a model.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 If you imagine the field of VR content creation as a river, it is one with two separate channels: that of 3D interactive development, and that of 360-degree video. Entry-level VR content creators-who often come from careers as developers or filmmakers-specialize in one route or the other almost without exception, and continue to do so after being promoted to audio director, head of 3D art, or principal director. It's only much later in the career, at the highest levels, that these two branches finally flow together. Someone who's responsible for running an XR company or overseeing the content programming of a new VR device must intimately understand both processes; only by understanding their distinct workflows and needs could a high-level producer or manager make accurate budget and timeline assessements. Add experience with complementary media like AR and MR, and you have a true virtual reality maven. Those who make it this far can leverage their superior and in-demand knowledge-base to take their pick of positions at major VR companies, work as interactive media specialists, or chart their own course as VR entrepreneurs.
 Finding Work
 The most common employment opportunity for virtual reality content creators is in Extended Reality (XR) companies-""XR"" being the umbrella term for Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR). XR companies tend to take on a variety of contracts from the entertainment, advertising, and nonprofit sectors, and may also participate in startup-style software development. In addition, many VR content creators work full-time for video game developers, film studios, advertising companies, museums, and VR hardware manufacturers like Oculus or Magic Leap.
 There is also a growing market for freelance VR content creators, who work wherever and whenever they want, designing their own ""assets""-3D models, animations, effects, and more-to be rented or sold on online marketplaces. Rarely, freelance VR content creators will even create their own standalone VR experiences to be distributed online or sold to a hardware manufacturer and packaged with a new headset.

 Interpersonal Skills
 Whether a content creator is getting out in the world to shoot 360-video or working remotely through game development software, the name of the game is collaboration. These are large projects with many moving parts, after all. When a big problem arises over the course of a shoot, or while crunching to meet a tight deadline, it's critical that each member of the team is an effective communicator with the problem-solving skills to resolve the situation independently when necessary. Flexibility, curiosity, and independence are absolutely essential. A passion for VR and a personal understanding of what makes immersive experiences so special is just icing on the cake.
 Work Life
 Most VR content creators work in a collaborative office environment. Those who work with video may travel for shoots and spend significant chunks of time in the field.

Vocal Coach,51122,Music Education,"vocal, artist, voice, sing, teach, teacher, ","What does a Vocal Coach do?
 As an instrument, the human voice is one of a kind. Not only is it uniquely linked to the body-altered by how the singer stands, breathes, or even eats-but it ´s also the only instrument in the world that can ´t be fully repaired or replaced if damaged. This is where vocal coaches come in. Drawing from a combination of technical knowledge and lived experience, these experienced singers work one-on-one to improve singers ´ raw performance ability, vocal technique, and vocal longevity.
 Vocal coaches may help their clients develop personalized warm-up routines, use exercises to improve their clients' range and breathing, work on articulation and projection ability, or provide other specialized instruction in advanced vocal techniques. Most vocal coaches begin teaching after gaining significant experience as performing singers. Some continue to work as performing musicians while giving lessons in home studios or online, while others set aside performing and land full-time positions with educational institutions. Still others may consult for television shows in Los Angeles, work with musical theater performers in New York, or travel on tour as the vocal coach to a high-profile performer. In addition to teaching and consulting, vocal coaches might also write books on technique, develop apps for singers, or create their own resources (e.g. warm-ups and exercises) for vocal coaching.
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Most vocal coaches work as performing vocalists and musicians for a long time before shifting to coaching. They may carry over specific expertise from their time as a performer-for example, some vocal coaches specialize in the techniques used by metal vocalists to produce screams and growls, while others work with successful pop artists who need to fill an arena with their voice. In general, there are a number of different ways to have a career as a vocal coach. Some work full-time at conservatories, while others hustle up freelance jobs while touring and performing.
 Finding Work
 Finding initial work as a vocal coach is the greatest obstacle for those wanting to break into this field. Advertising around the neighborhood, connecting with local music schools and programs, and making use of music industry contacts can help-but there's no substitute for a solid reputation as a longtime performer and singer. Once a steady flow of students has been established, additional business is generated mostly by word of mouth.

 Like all tutors, vocal coaches must be strong communicators. More importantly, though, vocal coaches must be exceptionally perceptive listeners. A good vocal coach is capable of picking up on a student ´s unconscious singing habits, technical weaknesses, and emotional and physical health from a single listen. Vocal coaches should also be flexible and nuanced in their approach; every voice is different, and the best vocal coaches tailor their approach to each student's needs.
 Work Life
 Work situations come in all shapes and sizes for vocal coaches. They may be salaried, contracted, or paid hourly. Similarly, they might work full-time, part-time, or extremely infrequently with a small number of high-profile clients. They might travel on a national tour as the resident vocal coach, fly coast to coast to work with clients around the country, or rarely leave their neighborhood and home studio.",https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/vocal-coach
Voiceover Artist,53121,"Acting, Theatre & Dance","voice, artist, vocal, voice actor, media, animation, anime","? Recorded voices are all around us. In fact, most people are so accustomed to hearing human voices integrated into their favorite products, spaces, and services that they might never stop to ask the obvious question: whose voice am I hearing? The answer, of course, is that of a voiceover artist. The center of a massive and rapidly expanding industry, voiceover artists are professional actors who use their voices to create characters, tell stories, communicate vital information, and connect with customers. Every day new performers flock to this popular career attracted by the flexible, work-from-home lifestyle or the dream of voicing the next Disney-Pixar film and yet demand for voiceover only seems to grow, as new work flows in from successful internet markets like the audiobook, online education, and phone app industries. Some may mourn the tight-knit communities, energetic studio sessions, and slower pace that characterized the pre-internet industry, but for the most part, there's never been a better time to be a voiceover artist.
 
 For voiceover artists, who typically work on projects in a wide variety of genres, every job requires a different skill set and a unique approach.
 
 Voiceover is a form of acting, but that doesn't mean that any actor can work in the voice industry. Many of the things ""regular"" actors rely on facial expressions, movements, sets, costumes, props are not an option in a purely auditory medium. For voiceover artists, who typically work on projects in a wide variety of genres, every job requires a different skill set and a unique approach. Reading an audiobook, for example, necessitates excellent diction and a steady reading voice, while voicing a video game might call for shouts, gasps, and grunts non-speaking cues delivered under the direction of a dialogue editor. Commercial is the broadest category of voiceover work, as a good commercial performance might be naturalistic, exaggeratedly theatrical, or even cartoonish depending on the material and direction. Some voiceover artists have very particular specialties, such as mimics, who excel at imitating famous actors and characters and are often hired to record ADR for those who are unavailable a difficult task which requires matching the delivery to the actor's on-screen mouth movements. At times, as when using motion capture technology, the line between voiceover artist and actor can grow blurry.
 
 At a Glance
 Career Path
 Voiceover artists come from a range of educational and career backgrounds. Many are experienced actors, singers, radio DJs, podcasters, and other professionals who work with their voices. Others lack significant performance experience but are drawn to the field by the promise of flexible, portable freelance work. At the beginning of the career, voiceover artists are unlikely to find enough work to support themselves solely through voiceover; fortunately, it's easy to combine this career with any number of side gigs. In fact, the voiceover industry is made up of a mix of semi-professionals, who pick up occasional jobs as a source of supplementary income, and successful top professionals, who are in high demand and make all of their living from voice work. Unlike more physically demanding performance careers, there's no age limit on this work, so voiceover artists can continue to be successful well into retirement years.
 
 Finding Work
 Voiceover artists are freelancers and might work on a wide range of projects, including audiobooks, commercials, documentaries, educational videos, corporate promotional materials, apps, toys, announcements, and phone prompts, as well as fictional media like animated films, dubbed series, video games, and radio dramas. When it comes to finding work, most use online marketplaces such as Voices.com(Opens in a new window), VoiceBunny(Opens in a new window), or Voice123(Opens in a new window), as well as the many general-purpose freelancer sites. Getting a gig might require the voiceover artist to record an audition specifically for the part as well as to submit their general purpose showreel (also called a voice reel or demo). A good showreel is recorded in a professional studio, cleaned and mixed by a professional engineer, and includes a wide range of content (commercial, documentary, dramatic, etc) while still being tailored to the actor's target market. It should also demonstrate any special skills, such as singing.
 
 At the beginning, voice gigs may be few and far between. Over time, voiceover artists can find additional work by partnering with an agent, setting up a website with a resum  and samples of past work, learning how to market themselves to potential buyers, and networking with major agencies and sources of repeat work. Forming a strong working relationship with a company that's heavily invested in the voice industry such as an audiobook company, animation studio, or game developer can lead to frequent repeat work. Recurring gigs, like voicing a character on an animated television show, can help those looking for more security and consistency in their work life.

 While a unique and ear-catching voice has helped many a voice actor rise to the top, it's all but useless if not aided by a suite of soft skills, the most important of which is versatility. This refers not to vocal flexibility itself a vital trait but to the ability to adjust quickly to feedback from a director, dialogue editor, or recording engineer and work well outside of one's comfort zone. Persistence is another key quality in this competitive profession, and will serve voiceover artists well when working to perfect a challenging voice. Professionalism is important; voice actors are expected to be punctual, reliable, and attentive. Finally, because voice actors must be capable of diving into their roles even in empty studio rooms as well as creating fictional worlds and characters solely with their voices, a powerful sense of imagination is vital. 
 
 Work Life
 The voiceover industry has been transformed by advancements in technology, and the biggest changes have been in the area of lifestyle. The ability to record, edit, and transmit high-quality audio on any personal computer means that, in most cases, it's no longer necessary for artists to be located in specific cities or travel to take part in expensive studio sessions. Today, most voiceover artists can find, audition for, and complete jobs from anywhere in the world as long as they have a computer, a microphone, and a grade-A voice. They have the ability to choose their own work and set their own schedules.
 
 However, not all changes are for the better. The globalization of the voiceover marketplace has drastically sped up an already fast-paced industry, and competition for jobs has never been higher. Voiceover artists who are aiming to rise to the top must be ready to take on and complete work requests at all hours of the day and night. When not in front of a microphone, voiceover artists might spend their time continuing voice lessons, pursuing new professional skills, or taking care of the many tasks that go into managing a freelance business.",https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/voiceover-artist
